window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nora Silk doesn't really fit in on Hemlock Street, where everyhouse looks the same. She's divorced. She wears a charm bracelet and high heels and red toreador pants. And the way she raises her kids is a scandal. But as time passes, the neighbors start having second thoughts about Nora. The women's apprehension evolves into admiration. The men's lust evolves into awe. The children are drawn to her in ways they can't explain. And everyone on this little street in 1959 Long Island seems to sense the possibilities and perils of a different kind of future when they look at Nora Silk. </p> <p>This extraordinary novel by the author of <i>TheRiver King</i> and <i>Local Girls</i> takes us back to a time when the exotic both terrified and intrigued us, and despite our most desperate attempts, our passions and secrets remained as stubbornly alive asthe weeds in our well-trimmed lawns.</p>";
