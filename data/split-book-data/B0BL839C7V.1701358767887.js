window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The ancient Greek maxim “know thyself” speaks to the age-old human desire for self-understanding. Generations have made countless attempts to force the very subjective concept of self-understanding into a scientific measurement of what makes us us. From these endeavors have emerged a selection of questionnaires that purport to measure our personality, which we can then use to help us determine what will likely make us happy or unhappy, in which environments will we thrive, what methods of communications we respond best to, and—in general—who we are.</p> <p>But not all personality tests are created equal, and most of them reflect very different aspects of our personality, even when the questions they are asking seem to be similar.</p> <p>Join Dr. Jaime Kurtz in <i>Personality Tests and What They Can Tell Us</i> to get the information you need to critically evaluate what the most popular personality tests measure and which ones are best suited for your goals. Dr. Kurtz will lead you through the history of personality testing to bring you to the most used tests today, such as the Myers-Briggs, the Enneagram, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the five-factor model. You’ll learn how these surveys were developed, what they can tell you, and the underlying science behind the study of personality.</p>";
