window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his follow-up to the acclaimed <i>Hellraisers</i>, Sellers traces the intertwining lives and careers of four outrageous Hollywood movie mavericks. </p> <p>“I don’t know what people expect when they meet me. They seem to be afraid that I’m going to piss in the potted palm and slap them on the ass.” - Marlon Brando </p> <p>“I should have been dead ten times over. I believe in miracles. It’s an absolute miracle that I’m still around.” - Dennis Hopper </p> <p> “You only lie to two people in your life: your girlfriend and the police.” - Jack Nicholson </p> <p>“The best time to get married is noon. That way, if things don’t work out, you haven’t blown the whole day.” - Warren Beatty </p> <p>They’re the baddest bad-asses Hollywood as ever seen: Marlon Brando, Dennis Hopper, Warren Beatty, and Jack Nicholson. They are men to whom rules did not apply; normal standards of behavior were simply too wearisome to worry about. These are men who brawled, boozed, snorted, and screwed their way into legend - but along the way they changed acting and the way movies were made forever. <i>Hollywood Hellraisers</i> is a whistle-stop tour of jaw-dropping sexual activity, misbehavior of an Olympic standard, all-out excess, and genuine madness. It’s a wonder Hollywood survived.</p>";
