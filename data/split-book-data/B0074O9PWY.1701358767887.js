Listen to <i>David Copperfield</i> narrated by Anton Lesser.</p><p></p><p>This much-loved novel was, by Dickens' own admission, his 'favorite child'. It is easy to see why, with its colorful characters ranging from the repulsive Uriah Heep to the endlessly improvident Micawbers, and dominated throughout by the moving story of David's search for a family and a home.</p>";
