window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sparkling, witchy reimagining of </b><b><i>Pride and Prejudice</i></b><b>, told from the perspective of the troublesome and—according to her—much-maligned youngest Bennet sister, Lydia.</b></p> <p>In this exuberant retelling of Jane Austen’s <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, Lydia Bennet puts pen to paper to relate the real events and aftermath of the classic story. Some facts are well known: Mrs. Bennet suffers from her nerves, Mr. Bennet suffers from Mrs. Bennet, and all five daughters suffer from an estate that is entailed only to male heirs.</p> <p>But Lydia also suffers from entirely different concerns: her best-loved sister Kitty is really a barn cat; Wickham is every bit as wicked as the world believes him to be, but what else would one expect from a demon? And if Mr. Darcy is uptight about etiquette, that’s nothing compared to his feelings about magic. Most of all, Lydia has yet to learn that for a witch, promises have power....</p> <p>Full of enchantment, intrigue, and boundless magic, <i>The Scandalous Confessions of Lydia Bennet, Witch</i>, has all the irreverent wit, strength, and romance of<i> Pride and Prejudice</i>—while offering a highly unexpected redemption for the wildest Bennet sister.</p>";
