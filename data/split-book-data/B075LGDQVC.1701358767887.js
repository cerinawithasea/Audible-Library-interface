window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Book Smugglers</i> is the nearly unbelievable story of ghetto residents who rescued thousands of rare books and manuscripts - first from the Nazis and then from the Soviets - by hiding them on their bodies, burying them in bunkers, and smuggling them across borders. It is a tale of heroism and resistance, of friendship and romance, and of unwavering devotion-including the readiness to risk one's life - to literature and art. </p> <p>And it is entirely true. Based on Jewish, German, and Soviet documents, including diaries, letters, memoirs, and the author's interviews with several of the story's participants, <i>The Book Smugglers</i> chronicles the daring activities of a group of poets turned partisans and scholars turned smugglers in Vilna, \"The Jerusalem of Lithuania\". </p>";
