Any student would be honored to go at all, much less get a scholarship.</p> <p>Not Chance Fortunato. Heâ€™d much rather stay at home and study under his mentor, Dr. Corwin. But when a student is attacked and his soul is ripped from his body, Chance knows he has to stay. Not only must he prove his innocence, but he is the only person in the state who has experience fighting the ancient blood magick that is being twisted to a new and terrible purpose.</p> <p>The stakes have never been higher, and Chance has never faced odds like these before. Stripped of his usual network of friends and allies, can he stop the attacks before they strike too close to home? Or will he be the next victim of a dark and terrible sorcery?</p>";
