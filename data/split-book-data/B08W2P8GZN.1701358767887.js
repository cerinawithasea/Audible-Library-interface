window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This daring Gothic thriller reinvents one of literature’s most twisted love triangles. Tensely romantic and deliciously suspenseful, </b><b><i>The Wife in the Attic</i></b><b> is perfect for fans of </b><b><i>Jane Eyre</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Rebecca</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Goldengrove’s towers and twisted chimneys rose at the very edge of the peaceful Weald, a stone’s throw from the poisonous marshes and merciless waters of Rye Bay. Young Tabby Palethorp had been running wild there, ever since her mother grew too ill to leave her room.</p> <p>I was the perfect choice to give Tabby a good English education: thoroughly respectable and far too plain to tempt her lonely father, Sir Kit, to indiscretion.</p> <p>I knew better than to trust my new employer with the truth about my past. But knowing better couldn’t stop me from yearning for impossible things: to be Tabby’s mother, Sir Kit’s companion, Goldengrove’s new mistress.</p> <p>All that belonged to poor Lady Palethorp. Most of all, I burned to finally catch a glimpse of her.</p> <p>Surely she could tell me who cut the strings on my guitar, why all the doors inside the house were locked after dark, and whose footsteps I heard in the night....</p> <p><b>With devious sophistication, Rose Lerner weaves a haunting tale full of secrets and sharp edges. Will the governess’ loyalties ultimately lie with the master of the house - or with the wife in the attic? </b></p>";
