window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is love? It's more scientific than you think.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through 10 illuminating lectures, Dr. Wind Goodfriend surveys the biology of interpersonal attraction, sexual preference and desire, and conflict resolution. You'll look at a variety of romantic notions, common myths, and love stereotypes through the lens of science in order to break them down and better set expectations when it comes to keeping a long-term relationship happy and healthy. You'll apply biology, psychology, and anthropology to that \"spark\" we feel when we are attracted to someone, to better understand what that feeling is.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mystery of love meets the power of science. And you'll never fall in love again - in quite the same way.</p>";
