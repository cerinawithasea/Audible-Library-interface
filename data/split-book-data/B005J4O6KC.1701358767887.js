window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The New World</i> is a prequel to the award-winning Chaos Walking trilogy, setting the stage for the world we discover in <i>The Knife of Never Letting Go, The Ask and the Answer</i>, and <i>Monsters of Men</i>. The story was written while the author served as writer in residence for the Booktrust an independent UK-wide charity dedicated to encouraging people of all ages and cultures to enjoy books.</p> <p><i>The New World</i> tells of Viola's journey to the New World, brilliantly capturing the hope and fear of settlers in search of a new life. Patrick Ness says that he wrote it \"as a huge and deeply-felt thank you to readers. I've had so many questions about Viola and what her life was like before that I couldn't resist the opportunity to reveal just a little bit extra. I knew these things - they're vitally important to her as a character, even if they're not directly in the novels - so it felt like a secret trip I could take readers on. The challenge was to make it work on its own, too, so anyone could read it. That was really, really good fun, and I hope the final result is an exciting one.\"</p> <p><i>The New World</i> can be listened to before or after the trilogy – and some may choose to do both. The story works as a standalone piece, but listeners already familiar with <i>The Knife of Never Letting Go</i> will learn more about Viola’s life and the events leading to her arrival and first encounter with Todd, while newcomers to the trilogy will discover a white-knuckle ride of an introduction to the series. Whether you're a new or faithful listener, though, it's a welcome chance to immerse yourself in the world of Chaos Walking.</p>";
