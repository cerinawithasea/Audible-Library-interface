window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eleven murders over a period of four years sent shockwaves through the Krugersdorp community and made headlines nationwide. Eventually these murders were connected to Cecilia Steyn and her cult, Electus per Deus (chosen by God). Members of the cult were willing to do anything for Cecilia - even if it meant committing murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>Who is Cecilia Steyn? How can one person manipulate five others to commit murder and perjury on her behalf? How did Satanism contribute to all of this? How did inexperienced criminals manage to evade capture for so long?&nbsp;</p> <p>Jana Marx answers these and other questions in this true-crime account that led to one of the most sensational murder cases in the country’s history. Through interviews with those in the inner circle, evidence given in court and police files covering a period of four years, Marx attempts to answer the public’s questions and provide a view of the inner workings of such a cult.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrated and produced by Nicole Engelbrecht.&nbsp;</p>";
