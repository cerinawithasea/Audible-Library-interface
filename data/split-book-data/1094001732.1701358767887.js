window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An elegant rendering of the great mystic's thoughts on the mysteries of the authentic life.</b></p> <p>This is a little book about soul freedom. It is a book about discovering the secret to all the things we most desire: contentment, meaning, peace of mind, and true freedom. This skillfully edited translation of selections from the writings of Meister Eckhart (c. 1260-1328) provides a road map to the spiritual life for contemporary seekers. Eckhart takes us on a journey of discovery, a journey in which we learn to let go, relinquish our need to know everything, and lose those things that we think are important for a life of worth. And in the end he shows us that the true secret is this: to find yourself, you must lose yourself.</p> <p>Here is timeless wisdom from a medieval mystic who has influenced a wide range of spiritual teachers and mystics both inside and outside the Christian tradition. Erich Fromm, Arthur Schopenhauer, Dag Hammarskjold, Eckhart Tolle, Richard Rohr, D. T. Suzuki, Rudolf Steiner, and Matthew Fox have all credited Eckhart as being an important influence on their thought. In addition, his work has influenced the development of 20th-century American Buddhism and the Theosophical tradition.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book, divided into five sections - \"Seeking the Light\", \"Facing Darkness\", \"Risking Love\", \"Knowing Nothing\", and \"Embracing Everything\" - leads listeners on the path to an authentic spiritual life.</p>";
