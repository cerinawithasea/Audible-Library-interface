window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A groundbreaking new work from National Book Award winner Imani Perry.</b></p> <p>Imani Perry’s Audible Original <i>A Dangerously High Threshold for Pain</i> tells the dramatic story of her ongoing struggle with lupus—an autoimmune disease that attacks multiple organ systems—and what we can all learn from those who are grappling with chronic illness. It’s a powerful and poetic story that evokes the works of Susan Sontag, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Audre Lorde.</p> <p>We follow Perry as her body sends her the first warning signs that something is wrong—“One afternoon something hurt in a way that folded my body in two...the pain felt biblical.” We are then taken on a journey through a medical labyrinth as she seeks solutions to her suffering and struggles to juggle illness, her high-flying career, and her personal life.</p> <p>This is a story not just about pain, but about hope, as Perry learns to coexist in her body with her disease and finds comfort in sharing her story. As she puts it, “I write to care for myself.\"</p>";
