window.bookSummaryJSON = "Originally published in the 16th century, this is the classic history of the lives, sufferings, and deaths of the early Christian martyrs. As interesting as fiction, it is written with both passion and tenderness, telling the dramatic story of some of the most thrilling periods in Christian history. Foxe brings to life the days when \"a noble army, men and boys, the matron and the maid, climbed the steep ascent of heaven, amid peril, toil, and pain.\" <p>After <i>The Bible</i> itself, no book so profoundly influenced early Protestant sentiment as the <i>Book of Martyrs</i>. Even in our time it is still a living force. It is more than a record of persecution. It is an arsenal of controversy, a storehouse of romance, as well as a source of edification.</p>";
