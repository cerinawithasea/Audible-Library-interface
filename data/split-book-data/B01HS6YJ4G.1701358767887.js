window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The real-world value of knowledge in the mobile-device age. </p> <p>More people know who Khloe Kardashian is than who Rene Descartes was. Most can't find Delaware on a map, correctly spell the word <i>occurrence</i>, or name the largest ocean on the planet. But how important is it to fill our heads with facts? A few keystrokes can summon almost any information in seconds. Why should we bother learning facts at all? </p> <p>Best-selling author William Poundstone confronts that timely question in <i>Head in the Cloud</i>. He shows that many areas of knowledge correlate with the quality of our lives - wealth, health, and happiness - and even with politics and behavior. Combining Big Data survey techniques with eye-opening anecdotes, Poundstone examines what Americans know (and don't know) on topics ranging from quantum physics to pop culture. </p> <p><i>Head in the Cloud</i> asks why we're okay with spelling errors on menus but not on résumés; why Fox News viewers don't know which party controls Congress; why people who know trivia make more money than those who don't; and how individuals can navigate clickbait and media spin to stay informed about what really matters. </p> <p>Hilarious, humbling, and wildly entertaining, <i>Head in the Cloud</i> is a must-listen for anyone who doesn't know everything. </p>";
