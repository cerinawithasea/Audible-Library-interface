The dramas were workshopped with LAMDA students and these final productions were recorded by graduating third years, working alongside talented industry directors.</p> <p>The result is four brilliantly unique dramas for a new generation that speak to the complex times we live in. We hope you enjoy listening to GNR8</p>";
