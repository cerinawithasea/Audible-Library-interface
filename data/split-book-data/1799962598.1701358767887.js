window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Make your writing and speech shine like the sun! Here’s the most entertaining and instructive book about enlivening and clarifying communication by comparing one thing to another.</p> <p>Ward Farnsworth provides a wide-ranging, practical tour of metaphors, arranged by theme. He shows how the best writers have put figurative comparisons to distinctive use - for the sake of caricature, to make an abstract idea visible, to make a complicated idea simple.</p> <p>Using hundreds of examples, Farnsworth demonstrates all the different stylistic ways that points can be unforgettably made. There are quotations from novelists, playwrights, philosophers, and orators - along with commentary on how and why they work to bring power to words both in person and and on paper.</p> <p>Writers and speakers, this book will make you a star.&nbsp;</p>";
