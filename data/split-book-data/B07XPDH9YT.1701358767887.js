window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why have viewers always had a love affair with romance movies? From tragic love stories, like <i>Romeo + Juliet,</i> to feel-good rom-coms, like <i>Sleepless in Seattle,</i> people simply cannot get enough of these movies. Join Professor Eric R. Williams to analyze dozens of titles that fall under the scope of \"romance films\"—inviting students to see old favorites in a new light and introduce them to elements of romance in movies one might not consider to be part of the genre.</p> <p>Explore traditional romantic titles, such as <i>When Harry Met Sally, West Side Story,</i> and <i>Casablanca</i>; controversial spins on the traditional genre, including <i>Her, Harold and Maude,</i> and <i>Lars and the Real Girl;</i> less conventional \"romances,\" such as <i>Blade Runner, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, She’s Gotta Have It,</i> and yes—even <i>Fight Club.</i> Throughout, Professor Williams draws on a wealth of examples, revealing the DNA of these films.</p> <p>Listeners will understand the difference between a love story and a romance; see how directors manipulate audiences’ emotions from opening credits to the final scene—keeping everyone on the edge of their seat; and be able to decode the underlying storytelling techniques. Students will see cinematic romances from a different point of view, deepening their understanding of the genre.</p>";
