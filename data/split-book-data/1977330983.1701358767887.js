But for all his charm and good looks, he was seemingly cursed with the ladies. His first marriage ended in divorce before the couple's fifth anniversary; his second wife plunged to her death during a hike; and his third wife left him after less than five months.</p> <p>But when Roth's fourth wife, Cynthia, drowned in an apparent speedboating accident in Washington State's Lake Sammamish just weeks after their first anniversary, a pattern of suspicious behavior finally caught up to him. As Roth set about collecting on a hefty insurance payout, the authorities were on to his game.</p> <p>Roth had been careful - and so close to getting away with it. But, as chronicled by<i> Seattle Times </i>reporter and Pulitzer Prize finalist Carlton Smith, his lies were about to come crashing down around him.</p>";
