window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Winner of the 2014 Ned Kelly Award and a 2015 Audie Award nominee for best mystery </p> <p>A Catholic cop tracks an IRA master bomber amidst the sectarian violence of the conflict in Northern Ireland </p> <p>It's the early 1980s in Belfast. Sean Duffy, a conflicted Catholic cop in the Protestant RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary), is recruited by MI5 to hunt down Dermot McCann, an IRA master bomber who has made a daring escape from the notorious Maze prison. In the course of his investigations Sean discovers a woman who may hold the key to Dermot's whereabouts; she herself wants justice for her daughter who died in mysterious circumstances in a pub locked from the inside. Sean knows that if he can crack the \"locked-room mystery\", the bigger mystery of Dermot's whereabouts might be revealed to him as a reward. Meanwhile the clock is ticking down to the Conservative Party conference in Brighton in 1984, where Mrs. Thatcher is due to give a keynote speech. </p>";
