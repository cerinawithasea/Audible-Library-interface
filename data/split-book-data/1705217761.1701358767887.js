She had a difficult childhood and a turbulent adolescence, but she was popular with the public, who looked to her to restore the good name of the monarchy.&nbsp;</p> <p>When she broke off her engagement to a Dutch prince, her father put her under virtual imprisonment and she endured a period of profound unhappiness. But she held out for the freedom to choose her husband, and when she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg she finally achieved contentment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her happiness was cruelly cut short when she died in childbirth at the age of 21 only 18 months later. A shocked nation went into mourning for its \"people's princess\", the queen who never was.</p>";
