window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An explosive, true-life southern gothic story, <i>Murder in the Bayou</i> chronicles the twists and turns of a high-stakes investigation into the murders of eight women in a troubled Louisiana parish. </p> <p>Between 2005 and 2009, the bodies of eight women were discovered around the murky canals and crawfish ponds of Jennings, Louisiana, a bayou town of 10,000 in the heart of the Jefferson Davis parish. Local law enforcement officials were quick to pursue a serial killer theory, opening a floodgate of media coverage, from CNN to the <i>New York Times</i>. Collectively the victims became known as the \"Jeff Davis 8,\" and their lives, their deaths, and the ongoing investigation reveals a small southern community's most closely guarded secrets. </p> <p>As Ethan Brown suggests, these homicides were not the work of a single serial killer, but the violent fallout of Jennings' brutal sex and drug trade, a backwoods underworld hidden in plain sight. Mixing muckraking research and immersive journalism over the course of a five-year investigation, Ethan Brown reviewed thousands of pages of previously unseen homicide files to determine what happened during each victim's final hours. </p> <p>Epic in scope and intensely suspenseful, <i>Murder in the Bayou</i> is the story of an American town buckling under the dark forces of poverty, race, and class division - and a lightning rod for justice for the daughters it lost. </p>";
