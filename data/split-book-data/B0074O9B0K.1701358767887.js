window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Timson talks about Charles Dickens, much loved for his great contribution to classic English Literature. Listen to <i>Oliver Twist</i> narrated by Anthony Lesser.</p><p><i>Oliver Twist</i>, Dickens' second novel, is a thrilling study of childhood innocence thrust into the darkly comic world of Fagin, his apprentice, the Artful Dodger, and their gang of child thieves. Who will help the orphaned Oliver to escape from their clutches and discover his true history?</p><p>The original story is even more powerful and compelling than the musical, which has popularized it. Anton Lesser reads with all his intensity and comic versatility.</p>";
