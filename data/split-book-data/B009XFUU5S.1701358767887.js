window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Police officer David Hanlin is asked to investigate the presumed murder of a child in an obscure rural village in Cornwall. During the protagonist's short stay, he is slowly subjected to a spectacle of psychological trickery, sexual seduction, ancient religious practices and nightmarish sacrificial rituals. Shrouded in the same brand of mystery and contradiction that forms its tangled plot, <i>Ritual</i>, the 1967 debut by playwright David Pinner, is commonly recognised to be the basis for the 1973 film, <i>The Wicker Man</i>, which has enthralled and inspired generations of film enthusiasts throughout the world.</p>";
