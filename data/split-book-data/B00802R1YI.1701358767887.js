window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the humorous, heartfelt new novel by the author of&nbsp;<i>The Next Thing on My List</i>,&nbsp;a personal organizer must somehow convince a reclusive artist to give up her hoarding ways and let go of the stuff she’s hung onto for decades.</p> <p>Lucy Bloom is broke, has been dumped by her boyfriend, and had to sell her house to send her 19-year-old son to drug rehab. Although she’s lost it all, she’s determined to start over. So when she’s offered a high-paying gig helping clear the clutter from the home of reclusive and eccentric painter Marva Meier Rios, Lucy grabs it. Armed with the organizing expertise she gained while writing her book,&nbsp;<i>Things Are Not People</i>, and fueled by a burning desire to get her life back on track, Lucy rolls up her sleeves to take on the mess that fills every room of Marva’s huge home. Lucy soon learns that the real challenge may be taking on Marva, who seems to love the objects in her home too much to let go of any of them.</p> <p>While trying to stay on course toward a strict deadline—and with an ex-boyfriend back in the picture, a new romance on the scene, and her son’s&nbsp;rehab not going as planned—Lucy discovers that Marva isn’t just hoarding: she is also hiding a big secret. The two form an unlikely bond, as each learns from the other that there are those things in life we keep and those we need to let go—but it’s not always easy to know the difference.</p> <p>Laugh-out-loud humor, heartfelt writing, relatable characters, and a charming premise all come together to make&nbsp;<i>Objects of My Affection</i>&nbsp;the next read for the fans of Jennifer Weiner, Emily Giffin, and Allison Winn Scotch.</p>";
