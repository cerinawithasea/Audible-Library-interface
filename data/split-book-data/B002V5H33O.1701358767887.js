window.bookSummaryJSON = "Long before the rise of mega-corporations like Wal-Mart and Microsoft, Standard Oil controlled the oil industry with a monopolistic force unprecedented in American business history. Undaunted by the ruthless power of its owner, John D. Rockefeller, a fearless and ambitious reporter named Ida Minerva Tarbell confronted the company known simply as \"The Trust\". <p>Through her peerless fact gathering and devastating prose, Tarbell pioneered the new practice of investigative journalism. Her shocking discoveries about Standard Oil and Rockefeller led to a dramatic confrontation that culminated in the landmark 1911 Supreme Court antitrust decision, forever altering the landscape of modern American industry. Based on extensive research, <i>Taking on the Trust</i> is a vivid and dramatic history of the Progressive Era, with powerful resonance for the early 21st century.</p>";
