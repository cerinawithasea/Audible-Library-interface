window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Boy (Tim Heidecker) is a dog who is tired of being held back by humans. When he wakes one morning to find his owner dead, he assumes there’s no one left to stop him from achieving his goal of being a wild and majestic wolf. Unfortunately, he’s about to meet Rebecca (Patti Harrison), a lifelong slacker who is out to prove to her roommates (Poppy Liu and Danny Pudi) that she’s not a total loser by getting a job as a dog walker for a start-up called Bow-Now. Her plan to become an overnight success gets off to a rough start when she arrives at the home of her first client to find a rowdy golden retriever and a dead body on the ground.</p> <p>Things go from bad to weird when Christof (Ravi Patel), the ex-child-celebrity founder of Bow-Now, activates a chip in Boy’s neck that gives him the ability to talk. Now, Rebecca is under pressure from the Bow-Now executive board (Amy Sedaris and Baron Vaughn) to deliver this ornery talking dog to the company headquarters without anyone finding out about his special ability. While Boy would rather focus on getting as far from humans as possible to achieve his wolf dream.</p> <p>Bad driving, betrayals, and a whole lot of butt sniffing ensue as Boy and Rebecca race across the state in pursuit of what they want. Or, at least, what they think they want.&nbsp;</p>";
