window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>I Killed Pink Floyd's Pig</i> is an all-access behind-the-scenes VIP tour of when rock was great, courtesy of Beau Phillips, a respected radio programmer and former head of marketing at MTV. </p> <p>Phillips was an insider and occasional accomplice who witnessed the legends of classic rock in their heyday and takes listeners inside the dressing rooms, hotel suites, and private planes of Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, and dozens more to enjoy funny, decadent, and never-been-told stories of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. </p> <p>The book's foreword was written by Sammy Hagar, former lead singer for Van Halen. He and Phillips met in the late 1970s, early in Hagar's career. Sammy wrote, \"Beau has seen all of the rock and roll craziness - and his book is loaded with amazing stories.\" </p>";
