window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The acclaimed sweeping history of a nation at war with itself, told here for the first time by the people who lived it.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Historian David Williams has written the first account of the American Civil War as viewed though the eyes of ordinary people - foot soldiers, slaves, women, prisoners of war, draft resisters, Native Americans, and others. Richly illuminated with little-known anecdotes and firsthand testimony, this path-breaking narrative moves beyond presidents and generals to tell a new and powerful story about America's most destructive conflict.</p>";
