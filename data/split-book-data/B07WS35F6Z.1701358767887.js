window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to John Leguizamo’s hilarious and educational take on 3,000 years of Latin history in 80 minutes.&nbsp;</p> <p>When his son gets a school assignment on heroes, John seizes the chance to teach him all about the great figures of Latin American history. But once he sets out on his irreverent crash course across three continents and three millennia of history—from conquistadores to cumbia, Montezuma to Menudo, and taking on the characters in all of it—he uncovers provocative truths that shock even him.</p> <p><i>Entertainment Weekly</i> called <i>Latin History for Morons</i> “boisterous and joyful” during its Broadway run at Studio 54, directed by Tony Taccone. A play that <i>The New York Times</i> says “poses sharp and timely questions of what culturally defines American identity,” Leguizamo’s newest solo adventure is educational and uproarious and is adapted exclusively for Audible.</p> <p><b>Please Note: </b><b><i>Latin History for Morons</i></b><b> contains adult language.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
