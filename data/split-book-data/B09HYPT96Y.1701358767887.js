window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Funeral for Flaca</i></b><b>&nbsp;is an exploration of things lost and found - love, identity, family - and the traumas that transcend bodies, borders, cultures, and generations.</b></p> <p>Emilly Prado&nbsp;retraces her experience coming of age as a prep-turned-chola-turned-punk in this collection that is one-part memoir-in-essays and one-part playlist, zigzagging across genres and decades, much like the rapidly changing and varied tastes of her youth. Emilly spends the late '90s and early aughts looking for acceptance as a young Chicana growing up in the mostly White suburbs of the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to Portland, Oregon, in 2008.&nbsp;<i>Ni de aquí, ni de allá</i>, she tries to find her place in the in-between.</p> <p>Growing up, the boys reject her, her father cheats on her mother, then the boys cheat on her, and she cheats on them. At 21-years-old, Emilly checks herself into a psychiatric ward after a mental breakdown. One year later, she becomes a survivor of sexual assault. A few years after that, she survives another attempted assault. She searches for the antidote that will cure her, cycling through love, heartbreak, sex, an eating disorder, alcohol, an ever-evolving style, and, of course, music.</p> <p>She captures the painful reality of what it means to lose and find your identity, many times over again.&nbsp;For anyone who has ever lost their way as a child or as an adult,&nbsp;<i>Funeral for Flaca</i>&nbsp;unravels the complex layers of an unpredictable life, inviting us into an intimate and honest journey profoundly told with humor and heart by Emilly Prado.&nbsp;</p>";
