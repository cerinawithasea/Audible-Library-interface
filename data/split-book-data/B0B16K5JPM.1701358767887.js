A growing resistance movement is active, angry, and looking to strike back. And a TV show for kids may be the key.</p> <p>Enter Celeste Montgomery and Bailey Vance. Celeste is an intern for the show that features Bailey singing and dancing with puppets. While Bailey teaches the kids about geography, Celeste is planting codes into the script, songs, background, whatever she can do to pass messages for the resistance.</p> <p>Celeste doesn't know who these messages are from or who they're for. But she’s certain about one thing—if the scheme is uncovered, it will be her head on the chopping block.</p> <p>Only the government got to Bailey first. And Celeste has no idea whose side he’s on.</p>";
