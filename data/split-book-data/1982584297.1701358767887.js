window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michelle and Cliff Stage bought their isolated vacation cabin in the mountains of North Carolina with hopes of repairing their 18-year marriage. But&nbsp;when Cliff disappears one night searching for the source of a mysterious light in the woods, Michelle’s life&nbsp;will change in unimaginable ways. After the sheriff’s department fails to find him, Michelle scrambles down the&nbsp;same dark mountainside alone, the strange, beckoning light her only guide.&nbsp;</p> <p>What she discovers is a cabin, identical to theirs, housing a life she barely recognizes - and a husband she hardly knows. Cliff is a changed&nbsp;man. Now caring and considerate, no longer a manipulative womanizer, he is also missing a finger. He claims that Cassie, their teenage daughter, is dead, killed in a car&nbsp;accident more than a year ago. Michelle knows that’s not possible - Cassie had phoned her from Atlanta only hours before.&nbsp;Even when shown Cassie’s grave, Michelle refuses to accept she’s gone.</p> <p>Michelle wants her daughter and her life back, and the only clue to what has happened is a man named Pink. A real estate agent and the man who&nbsp;years earlier built Michelle and Cliff’s cabin, Pink was rumored to have killed his wife and buried her on the property, then&nbsp;vanished, never to be seen again. But in Michelle’s new reality, Pink and his wife still reside in town and Pink’s smile-splashed billboards are everywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p>To get back to the world where her&nbsp;daughter exists, Michelle must unravel the mystery of Pink while questioning her very reality - and her sanity. Haunting, atmospheric, and deeply thought-provoking, <i>The Cabin on Souder Hill</i> questions the very nature of our existence and the choices we make to form it.</p>";
