window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gothic romance with a twist. </p><p>Elements of <i>The Sound of Music</i>, <i>The Enchanted Garden</i>, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and \"true\" ghost hunting shows make this story feel familiar. Gay love makes it unique. </p><p>Seeing an ad for a position at a Yorkshire estate, typesetter Graham Cowrie decides to make an upward career move by passing himself off as a tutor. How hard can it be to teach a few subjects to a pair of nine-year-old boys? But on his arrival at the ancient house, he finds the staff creepy, the twins odd, and the widowed master temporarily absent. </p><p>His first meeting with brooding, stern, but oh-so-attractive Sir Richard doesn't go well, but with no other prospects vying for the teaching position, Graham manages to keep it. His mission soon becomes clear: break down the walls of reserve both father and sons have erected, and attempt to bridge the gap between them. </p><p>But strange sounds, sights, and experiences keep Graham on edge until he finally admits the Hall is haunted by two entities with very different agendas. Graham works to appease one and combat the other, while protecting the broken family he's grown to care for. </p>";
