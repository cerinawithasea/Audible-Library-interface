window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The story follows the life of Tina, a young woman caught between the mother who adopted her - the beautiful, upstanding Delia - and her true mother, her plain, unmarried ‘aunt’ Charlotte, who gave Tina up to provide her with a socially acceptable life.</p> <p> The three women live quietly together until Tina’s wedding day, when Delia’s and Charlotte’s hidden jealousies rush to the surface. Originally serialized in <i>The Red Book</i> magazine in 1922, The Old Maid is an examination of class and society as only Edith Wharton could undertake.</p>";
