window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Perhaps the most compelling murder case of our day, the death of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey galvanized the nation - and years after it occurred, the mystery still endures. Who killed the young beauty queen and why? Who is covering up for whom, and who is simply lying? In <i>JonBenet</i>, the most authoritative and comprehensive study of the Ramsey murder, a former lead Boulder Police detective, Steve Thomas, explores the case in vivid and fascinating detail - pointing the way toward an analysis of the evidence some deem too shocking to consider. </p> <p>Here, Thomas raises these and many other provocative questions: </p> <p>How was the investigation botched from the beginning, and why did police so carelessly allow the crime scene to be tampered with? </p> <p>Why were John and Patsy Ramsey protected from early questioning and any lie-detector tests, even though their stories and behavior were erratic, suspicious, and inconsistent? </p> <p>Why was crucial evidence ignored, why were certain key witnesses unquestioned by detectives, and why were the Ramseys privy to sensitive information about the case and even police reports? </p>";
