window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A shocking thriller by the bestselling author of </b><b><i>Girls of Glass</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>It seems like an open-and-shut case for FBI special agent Lucy Thorne when Eliza Cook walks into the field office. The teenage girl confesses to murdering a young boy. Disturbingly composed, she reveals chilling details only the killer could know. Beyond that Eliza doesn't say another word, leaving a vital question met with dead silence: Why did she do it?</p> <p>To find the answer, Lucy goes to the scene of the crime in the small Idaho town of Knox Hollow. But Lucy's questions are only mounting. Especially when sheâ€™s drawn deeper into the life of the victim. Then a combing of the woods yields unsettling evidence that Eliza isn't the only one in this close-knit rural community with secrets.</p> <p>Getting to the truth is becoming Lucy's obsession. And it's a dangerous one. Because for the good folks of Knox Hollow, hiding that truth will take more than silence.</p>";
