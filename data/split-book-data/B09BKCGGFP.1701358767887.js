window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A man desperate to know his true identity struggles to solve the infamous kidnapping that nearly destroyed his family - and find his twin sister, who has been missing for more than 50 years.</b></p> <p>When he was 10 years old, Paul Fronczak was snooping around for Christmas presents in a crawl space in his family’s Chicago home. There, he found hundreds of old newspaper clippings about the kidnapping of a one-day-old infant in a hospital in 1964. He also learned that, two years later, the boy was found and returned to his family - and that the boy was him.</p> <p>Nearly 50 years later, Paul, acting on long-held suspicions, took a DNA test that proved he was not the kidnapped boy. In an instant, he found himself at the center of two half-century-old mysteries - who was he, and where was the real Paul?</p> <p><i>True Identity</i>&nbsp;is about three separate major investigations - the hunt for the real Paul Fronczak; the search for the author’s missing twin sister, Jill; and finally, the investigation into his true identity, his heart and soul and the demons inside him - inherited and created - that still need to be confronted.</p>";
