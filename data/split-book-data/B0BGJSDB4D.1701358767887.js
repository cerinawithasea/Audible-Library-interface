window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A committed Inspector James and a young detective Amar Sagar come together to solve the murder case of Kishore, who was the manager of Harsha Shinde—a well-known businessman. Clues they untie lead them no-where while instances they encounter lead them to believe it as an accident and close the case. Restless Amar continues his investigation as he believes it is a murder. As enigma overshadows facts, suspicion turns over to everyone in the family. Can Amar foresee the hidden meaning in those clues? Is the murderer one among the shinde's family members? Will Amar's hypothesis help him to solve the case or will it leave him spell-bound? Clues are meant to lead a criminal case to convergence. Criminals are bound to leave a clue. But case no. 56 does impose big reluctance to these beliefs. Join the journey of investigation with the duo as they unveil some unbelievable truths.</p>";
