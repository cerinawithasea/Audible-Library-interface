window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From television writer Stephanie K. Smith (<i>Carnival Row</i>; <i>Genius: Picasso</i>) comes <i>Wrecked</i>, a mystical story about historical treasure, generational trauma, and the power of transcendence.</p> <p>When aging fisherman Louis Mann hears a voice summoning him to an off-limits stretch of Long Island Sound, he knows he might be going crazy but feels compelled to heed the call. A big enough haul of summer flounder could be the windfall Lou needs to change his life–what little time he has left. But then his nets get stuck on something lodged in the ocean floor, uncovering a mystery that quickly ensnares three equally damaged strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Phil, a disgraced Navy diver with a lifetime of resentments; Samantha, a wealthy antiques dealer on the brink of divorce; and Nick, a teenaged artist raised by neo-Nazis are all at rock bottom, just like Lou. And each is convinced that the old man’s discovery–a centuries-old ship–will be their salvation.</p> <p>Lou, Samantha, Phil and Nick will all have to face the forces that formed them before they can reap any reward pulled from the depths of the Sound. For as magical as <i>La Difesa</i> may be, the wreck alone cannot save anyone. It can only push them to save themselves...if they’re willing.</p>";
