But why would you want to collect the possessions of a serial killer?</p> <p>Journalists Poppy Damon and Alice Fiennes travel from New York to Scotland to probe one of the internet's strangest subcultures – the people from all over the world who can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on so-called \"murderabilia\".</p> <p>From the Muswell Hill Murderer, Dennis Nilsen, to Charles Manson, the duo explore the grisly yet lucrative business in trading everything from handwritten letters to prisoners' hairbrushes.</p> <p>They also examine our seemingly insatiable appetite for the macabre, asking if there is a link between serial killer collectables and the true crime podcasting boom? Poppy and Alice hear that sometimes collectors are drawn to the idea that these objects could offer insight into the minds of dark figures like Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, or The Night Stalker.</p> <p>This is an Audible Original Podcast.
