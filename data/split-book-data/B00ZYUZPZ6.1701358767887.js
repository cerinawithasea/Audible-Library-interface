window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Lucifer Priciple</i> is a revolutionary work that explores the intricate relationships among genetics, human behavior, and culture to put forth the thesis that \"evil\" is a by-product of nature's strategies for creation and that it is woven into our most basic biological fabric. Though this argument is not a new one - it has been brought forth by such great historical figures as St. Paul, Thomas Hobbes, and Raymond Dart - Howard Bloom here takes fresh data from a variety of sources and shapes it into a lens through which listeners can reinterpret the human experience. </p>";
