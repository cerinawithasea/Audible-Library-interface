window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A best seller in its native Canada, <i>Drunk Mom</i> is a gripping, brutally honest memoir of motherhood in the shadow of alcoholism. </p> <p>Three years after giving up drinking, Jowita Bydlowska found herself throwing back a glass of champagne like it was ginger ale. It was a special occasion: a party celebrating the birth of her first child. It also marked Bydlowska's immediate, full-blown return to crippling alcoholism. </p> <p>In the gritty and sometimes grimly comic tradition of the best-selling memoirs <i>Lit</i> by Mary Karr and <i>Smashed</i> by Koren Zailckas, <i>Drunk Mom</i> is Bydlowska's account of the ways substance abuse took control of her life - the binges and blackouts, the humiliations, the extraordinary risk-taking - as well as her fight toward recovery as a young mother. This courageous memoir brilliantly shines a light on the twisted logic of an addicted mind and the powerful, transformative love of one's child. Ultimately, it gives hope, especially to those struggling in the same way.</p>";
