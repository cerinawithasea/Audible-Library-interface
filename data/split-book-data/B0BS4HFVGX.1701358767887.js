window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They got everything they wanted...but never had each other.</b></p> <p>Touré Wallace and Niomi Spencer were close friends at Finley College, the prestigious HBCU they&nbsp;attended. The attraction that simmered between them every semester was a question they&nbsp;never got to ask or answer before soaring ambitions launched them to opposite corners of the world. Both chased their dreams of grit and glamor as high-profile journalists. They got it all...except a shot at being more than friends.</p> <p>Years later, Touré is an award-winning investigative journalist and Niomi is America's most popular morning-show host, but they both feel like something’s missing. When their alma mater recruits its most famous alums for an interview during homecoming, every look, every touch is electric. The air hums with what could have been, and they're tempted by what they could have right now,&nbsp;if only for one weekend. Have they traveled the world, chasing something special, when all it took was coming home?</p> <p><b>Featuring the musical stylings of Southern University’s marching band, Human Jukebox!</b></p>";
