window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The unforgettable saga of one enslaved woman's fight for justice - and reparations</b></p> <p>Born into slavery, Henrietta Wood was taken to Cincinnati and legally freed in 1848. In 1853, a Kentucky deputy sheriff named Zebulon Ward colluded with Wood's employer, abducted her, and sold her back into bondage. She remained enslaved throughout the Civil War, giving birth to a son in Mississippi and never forgetting who had put her in this position.</p> <p>By 1869, Wood had obtained her freedom for a second time and returned to Cincinnati, where she sued Ward for damages in 1870. Astonishingly, after eight years of litigation, Wood won her case: In 1878, a Federal jury awarded her $2,500. More important than the amount, though the largest ever awarded by an American court in restitution for slavery, was the fact that any money was awarded at all.</p> <p>McDaniel's audiobook is an epic tale of a Black woman who survived slavery twice and who achieved more than merely a moral victory over one of her oppressors. Above all, <i>Sweet Taste of Liberty</i> is a portrait of an extraordinary individual as well as a searing reminder of the lessons of her story, which establish beyond question the connections between slavery and the prison system that rose in its place.</p>";
