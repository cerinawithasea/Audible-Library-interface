window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rome, August AD 89. Flavia Albia, the daughter of Marcus Didius Falco, has taken up her father's former profession as an informer. On a typical day, it's small cases - cheating spouses, employees dipping into the till - but this isn't a typical day. Her beloved, the plebeian Manlius Faustus, has recently moved in and decided that they should get married in a big, showy ceremony as part of beginning a proper domestic life together. Also, his contracting firm has been renovating a run-down building, a bar called the Garden of the Hesperides, where they uncover human remains buried in the backyard. </p> <p>For years there had been rumors that the previous owner of the bar, now deceased, killed a barmaid, and these are presumably her remains. In the choice between planning a big wedding to-do and looking into a crime from long ago, Albia would much rather investigate a possible murder - or murders, as more and more remains are uncovered, revealing that something truly horrible has been going on at the Hesperides. </p> <p>As Albia gets closer to the truth behind the bodies in the backyard, her investigation has put her in the crosshairs - which might be the only way she'll get out of the wedding preparations and away from all her relatives who are so very anxious to help out. </p>";
