window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A savage murder, committed the same day Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. A young black man is falsely accused. In the style of Truman Capote's <i>In Cold Blood</i>, Erik German's Kindle Single <i>Dead Girls</i> picks up where the reporters left off - just in time for the 50th anniversary of a crime that captivated the nation. </p><p>On August, 28, 1963, two young white women were found slain and mutilated in their apartment on New York's Upper East Side. Dubbed the \"Career Girls Murders,\" the case inspired the television series \"Kojack\" and was cited in U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Miranda ruling, which required police to read suspects their rights before interrogations. </p><p>German's novella re-imagines this captivating drama, highlighting long-ignored aspects of the case and offering a glimpse inside lives that changed U.S. history. </p><p>Erik German began his career covering crime, local politics and corruption as a staff writer for Newsday, before working as a foreign correspondent for GlobalPost and roving national correspondent for The Daily. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and daughter. </p>";
