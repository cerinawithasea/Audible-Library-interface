window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Timson talks about Charles Dickens, much loved for his great contribution to classic English Literature. Listen to <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> narrated by Anton Lesser.</p><p><i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, Dickens' first novel, is a glorious romp through the pre-Reform Bill England of 1827. Traveling by stage-coach, the innocent but well-intentioned Pickwick and his equally naive friends, all in search of \"interesting scenes and characters,\" are repeatedly saved from disaster by the resourceful and quick-witted Sam Weller.</p>";
