window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Harvey Kellogg was one of America's most beloved physicians; a best-selling author, lecturer, and health-magazine publisher; founder of the Battle Creek Sanitarium; and patron saint of the pursuit of wellness. His youngest brother, Will, was the founder of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which revolutionized the mass production of food and what we eat for breakfast.</p> <p>In <i>The Kelloggs</i>, Howard Markel tells the sweeping saga of these two extraordinary men, whose lifelong competition and enmity toward one another changed America's notion of health and wellness from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries, and who helped change the course of American medicine, nutrition, wellness, and diet.</p> <p>As Markel chronicles the Kelloggs' fascinating, <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>-like ascent into the pantheon of American industrialists, we see the vast changes in American social mores that took shape in diet, health, medicine, philanthropy, and food manufacturing during seven decades - changing the lives of millions and helping to shape our industrial age.</p>";
