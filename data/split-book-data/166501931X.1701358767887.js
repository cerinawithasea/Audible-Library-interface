window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Based on Portuguese legend, this #OwnVoices historical fantasy is an epic tale of mystery, magic, and making the impossible choice between love and duty....</b></p> <p>With just one touch, bread turns into roses. With just one bite, cheese turns into lilies.&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s a famine plaguing the land, and Princess Yzabel is wasting food simply by trying to eat. Before she can even swallow, her magic - her <i>curse </i>- has turned her meal into a bouquet. She’s on the verge of starving, which only reminds her that the people of Portugal have been enduring the same pain for years.&nbsp;</p> <p>If only it were possible to <i>reverse</i> her magic. Then she could turn flowers <i>into</i> food.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fatyan, a beautiful Enchanted Moura, is the only one who can help. But she is trapped by magical binds. She can teach Yzabel how to control her curse - if Yzabel sets her free with a kiss.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the King of Portugal’s betrothed, Yzabel would be committing treason, but what good is a king if his country has starved to death?</p> <p>With just one kiss, Fatyan is set free. And with just one kiss, Yzabel is yearning for more.&nbsp;</p> <p>She’d sought out Fatyan to help her save the people. Now, loving her could mean Yzabel’s destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>A Curse of Roses<i> includes themes, imagery, and content that might be triggering for some listeners. Discussions of religious-based self-harm, religious-based eating disorders, and religious-based internalized homophobia appear throughout the novel.</i></p>";
