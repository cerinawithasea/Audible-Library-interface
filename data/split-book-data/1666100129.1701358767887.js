window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>True stories of hauntings, possessions, and things that go bump in the night.</p> <p>Built in 1847 on the banks of the Ohio River, the Bellaire House is reputed to be one of the most haunted houses in America. Since the early 20th century it has earned a reputation as a hotbed of paranormal activity, with reports of apparitions, curses, psychic assaults, and violence.</p> <p>This is a collection of true ghost stories from the owner of the Bellaire House and the proprietor of the Bellaire House Afterlife Research Center. It is a mix of lurid and heartwarming stories that both entertain and convey to the listener what the dead want us to know. Stories include accounts of a ghostly sexual assault, communications from spirits of slaves (the house was part of the Underground Railroad) and French and Native American ghosts from the 18th-century battlefield, and tales of madness.</p>";
