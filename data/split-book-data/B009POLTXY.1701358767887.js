window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As presidential candidates sling dirt at each other, America desperately needs a few real heroes. Tragically, liberal historians and educators have virtually erased traditional American heroes from history. According to the Left, the Founding Fathers were not noble architects of America but selfish demagogues, and self-made entrepreneurs like Rockefeller were robber barons and corporate polluters. Instead of honoring great men from America’s past, kids today now idolize rock stars, pro athletes, and Hollywood celebrities. </p> <p>In his new book, author Brion McClanahan rescues the legendary deeds of the greatest Americans and shows why we ought to venerate heroes like Captain John Smith, adventurer Daniel Boone, General Robert E. Lee, and many more. <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Real American Heroes</i> not only resuscitates America’s forgotten heroes but sheds light on the Left’s most cherished figures, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Kennedys. </p> <p>With biting wit and devastating detail, McClanahan strikes back against the multicultural narrative peddled by liberal historians who make heroes out of pop-culture icons and corrupt politicians. In America’s hour of peril, McClanahan’s book is a timely and entertaining call to remember the heritage of this great nation and the heroes who built it. </p> <p>Brion McClanahan is author of <i>The Founding Fathers’ Guide to the Constitution, The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers,</i> and holds an MA and Ph.D. in American history from the University of South Carolina.</p>";
