window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Although Roe v. Wade identified abortion as a constitutional right 45 years ago, it still bears stigma - a proverbial scarlet A. Millions of Americans have participated in or benefited from an abortion, but few want to reveal that they have done so. Approximately one in five pregnancies in the US ends in abortion. Why is something so common, which has been legal so long, still a source of shame and secrecy? Why is it so regularly debated by politicians and so seldom divulged from friend to friend?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In public discussion, both proponents and opponents of abortion's legality tend to focus on extraordinary cases. This tendency keeps the national debate polarized and contentious and keeps our focus on the cases that occur the least.</p> <p>Professor Katie Watson focuses instead on the cases that happen the most, which she calls \"ordinary abortion\".<i> Scarlet A </i>gives the reflective listener a more accurate impression of what the majority of American abortion practice really looks like. It explains how our silence around private experience has distorted public opinion, and how, including both ordinary abortion and abortion ethics, could make our public exchanges more fruitful.</p>";
