window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From a shadowy realm not far from our own, dark beings have slipped unnoticed into the world.</p> <p>It started that cold night spent in the woods, all those years ago. Owen and Chloe had wakened something, something inside them both. But, for a while at least, they’d thought they could live normal lives.…</p> <p>Here the blind Guitar Man gives insane advice on the brink between reality and nightmare; eerie clones known as umbriates sneak into the world with murderous intent; and the once-imaginary being called Ozy is gathering strength and followers in his effort to rip through the very fabric of reality with the intent of dominance and darkness. And only Owen and Chloe can stop him.</p> <p>A surreal tale of horror and heartbreak, rife with dark oddities, wonderfully realized characters, and terrifying nightmares.</p>";
