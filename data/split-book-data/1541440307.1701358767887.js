window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One by one, three waterlogged suitcases were pulled from the Chesapeake Bay. In each were body parts of a man. In a forensics room, the truth was discovered: William McGuire had been horribly murdered and dismembered.&nbsp;</p> <p>William and his loving wife, a registered nurse named Melanie, had just closed on their New Jersey dream home. Little did William know about the nightmare that was in store . . . . For Melanie had been involved in a long-term affair with a married doctor at the fertility clinic where she worked - and she had plans for the future that didn't include William.&nbsp;</p> <p>Investigators believe that on April 29, 2004, Melanie first drugged her husband, then murdered him in cold blood. Three years after America witnessed the details of the suitcase incident unfold - on 48 Hours, Dateline NBC, and ABC Primetime, and in People magazine, among other news outlets - Melanie was convicted of first-degree murder and desecrating human remains. <i>To Have and to Kill </i>is the true story of a marriage that turned deadly . . . .</p>";
