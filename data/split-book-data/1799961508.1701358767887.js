window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A paramedic story that takes places in the wild and sheds a never-seen-before light on wilderness medicine, our national parks, and conflicts that arise between tourism and protecting the land</p> <p><i>Wild Rescues</i> is a fast-paced, firsthand glimpse into the exciting lives of paramedics who work with the National Park Service: a unique brand of park rangers who respond to medical and traumatic emergencies in some of the most isolated and rugged parts of America. In 2014, Kevin Grange left his job as a paramedic in Los Angeles to work in a response area with 2.2 million acres: Yellowstone National Park. Seeking a break from city life and urban EMS, he wanted to experience pure nature, fulfill his dream of working for the National Park Service, and take a crash-course in wilderness medicine. Between calls, Grange reflects upon the democratic ideal of the National Park mission, the beauty of the land, and the many threats facing it. With visitation rising, budgets shrinking, and people loving our parks to death, he realized that - along with the health of his patients - he was also fighting for the life of “America’s Best Idea”.</p>";
