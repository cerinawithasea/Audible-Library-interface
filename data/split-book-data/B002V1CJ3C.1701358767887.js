window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the best-selling tradition of <i>The Devil in the White City</i>, award-winning author Brian Hicks tells the explosive story of the <i>Morro Castle</i>, the elegant luxury ocean liner that burned off the coast of New Jersey on September 7, 1934.<p> The captain of the luxurious Ward Line flagship died under mysterious circumstances seven hours before his ship caught. Much of the crew abandoned ship, leaving passengers to burn or jump into the sea as a hurricane approached and literally fanned the flames. The ship was incinerated, and 134 people perished.</p><p> Using hundreds of previously classified FBI reports, first-person survivor interviews, and countless documents, Brian Hicks has written  and solved  a murder mystery that mesmerized the nation more than 70 years ago. Told with authentic period detail and true-crime excitement, Hicks determines that the ominous weather was not the cause for the ship's burning. From Hick's deeply researched epic, we can only conclude that the disaster was the work of a madman among the crew.</p><p> Hicks creates a finely drawn portrait of Depression-era America. Perfect for history buffs and adventure enthusiasts, <i>When the Dancing Stopped</i> is nonfiction narrative at its best.</p>";
