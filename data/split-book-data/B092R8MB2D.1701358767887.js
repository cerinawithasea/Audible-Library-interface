window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sprung from the roots of '70s hard rock, Metallica defined the look and sound of 1980s heavy metal, just as Led Zeppelin had for hard rock and the Sex Pistols for punk before them. Inventors of thrash metal - Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth followed - it was always Metallica who led the way, who pushed to another level, who became the last of the superstar rockers.</p> <p>Though plagued by adversities, including the death of their bassist in a bus crash, infighting and substance abuse, they survived to became the biggest-selling band in the world. With 100 million records sold worldwide, their music has extended its reach beyond rock and metal, and into the pop mainstream, as they went from speed metal to MTV with their hit single \"Enter Sandman\". Until now there hasn't been a critical, authoritative, in-depth portrait of the band. Mick Wall's thoroughly researched, insightful work is enriched by his interviews with band members, record company execs, roadies, and fellow musicians. He tells the story of how a tennis-playing, music-loving Danish immigrant named Lars Ulrich created a band with singer James Hetfield and made his dreams a reality. <i>Enter Night </i>delves into the various incarnations of the band, and the personalities of all key members, past and present - especially Ulrich and Hetfield - to produce the definitive word on the biggest metal band on the planet</p>";
