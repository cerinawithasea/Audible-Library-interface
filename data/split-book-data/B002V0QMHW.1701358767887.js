He helped bring to the screen some of the most acclaimed Oscar-winning films of our time, including Apocalypse Now, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, and Sleepless in Seattle.<p>Of course, there are the box-office disasters, which also have a place in his fascinating memoir, a pull-no-punches account of financial and political maneuvering, of creativity stymied, and of working with the industry's brightest star power.</p><p>An eyewitness to Hollywood history in the making, Medavoy gives a powerful and poignant view of the past and future of a world he knows intimately.</p>";
