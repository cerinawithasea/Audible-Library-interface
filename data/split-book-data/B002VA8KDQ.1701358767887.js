window.bookSummaryJSON = "Internationally best-selling author Amitav Ghosh, winner of the Pushcart Prize and numerous other prestigious accolades, pens a sweeping novel full of romantic adventure. Favorably compared to the masterworks of Joseph Conrad and V.S. Naipaul, <i>The Hungry Tide</i> is an atmospheric tale set in a world of wondrous sights...and terrible danger. <p>Off the eastern coast of India lies an extraordinary cluster of islands known as the Sundarbans. It is a raw but beautiful area, a place of man-eating tigers, river dolphins, huge crocodiles, and devastating tides that sweep across the terrain without remorse. In this exotic land, marine biologist Piya, fisherman Fokir, and translator Kanai meet. As they travel deep into the remote archipelago, they experience a territory at risk not only from natural disaster, but also from human foolishness and volatile politics.</p> <p>Hailed as \"a novelist of dazzling ingenuity\" by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Ghosh delivers a rich and evocative story of profound truths staged against an unforgettable backdrop.</p>";
