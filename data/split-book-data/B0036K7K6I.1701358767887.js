window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sensationalism and hysteria of the rescue attempt in early 1925 of caver Floyd Collins generated America's first true media spectacle and one of the seminal events of the century.</p><p>The crowds that gathered outside Sand Cave in Kentucky turned the rescue site into a carnival. Collins's situation was front-page news throughout the country, hourly bulletins interrupted radio programs, and Congress recessed to hear the latest word.</p><p>With a new epilogue revealing additional information about the Floyd Collins story that has come to light since the book was first published, <i>Trapped!</i> is both a tense adventure and a brilliant historical recreation of the past.</p>";
