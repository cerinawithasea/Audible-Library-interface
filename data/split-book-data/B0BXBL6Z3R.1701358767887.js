window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>High school star athlete Colin Kaepernick is at a crossroads in life. Heavily scouted by colleges and MLB, he has a bright future ahead of him as a highly touted baseball pitcher. Everyone—from his parents to his teachers and coaches—is in agreement about his seemingly clear path. Except Colin feels differently.</p> <p>Colin isn’t excited about baseball. In the words of five-time all-star MLB player Adam Jones, “Baseball is a White man’s game.” Colin looks up to athletes like Allen Iverson: talented, hyper-competitive, unapologetically Black, and dominating their sports while staying true to themselves. College football looks a lot more fun than sleeping on hotel room floors in the minor leagues of baseball. But Colin doesn't have a single scholarship offer to play football. Yet.</p> <p><i>Change the Game</i> is an audio adaptation of celebrated athlete and activist Colin Kaepernick’s YA graphic memoir, where he looks back on a pivotal decision he faced as a baseball pitcher during his senior year of high school. Narrated by Colin Kaepernick, this audiobook features a stellar cast including Jaden Michael (<i>Colin in Black and White</i>).</p> <p>This touching story explores how a young change-maker learned to find himself and never compromise. How the right decision is rarely the easy one, but taking the road less traveled can make all the difference in the world.</p> <p>Narrators:</p> <ul> <li>Colin Kaepernick</li> <li>Sean Corvelle</li> <li>Piper Goodeve</li> <li>Gabriel Vaughan</li> <li>Shayna Small</li> <li>Marcella Cox</li> <li>Emily Bauer</li> <li>JD Jackson</li> <li>Joniece Abbott-Pratt</li> <li>Kevin T.
