window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A true multigenerational story of how one family had and lost it all along the US-Mexican border.</p> <p>Pietro La Greca Sr. was an intimidating Napolitano con man dubbed “Mexico’s real-life Don Corleone”. He ran Mexico’s biggest money-laundering scheme during the worst economic period in the country’s history. His was a world of fast cars, mansions on the water, and VIP treatment at Las Vegas casinos. His exploitation of Mexico’s financial free fall made him a wealthy man. But while he was running his criminal empire, his son, Pietro Jr., a.k.a. Picho, was learning his father’s tricks—if only to bring the man down.</p> <p>An epic tale of greed, high-finance scams, drug cartels, and brazen corruption by the rich and powerful on both sides of the border, Pesos is as personal as it is lavish and fantastical. At its heart is Pietro La Greca Jr., who reveals a decades-long family struggle over the boundaries of loyalty, betrayal, and love, and his soul-crushing quest to free himself from the sins of his father.</p>";
