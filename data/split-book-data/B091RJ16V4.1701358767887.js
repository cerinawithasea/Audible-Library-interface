window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With an entirely fresh take on presidential history, James Swanson, author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling, Edgar Award-winning <i>Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln’s Killer</i>, shares the story of his lifelong obsession with the murder of America’s most revered president and the frantic hunt for his assassin.</p> <p>The renowned Lincoln scholar treats listeners to an audible “walking tour” of the people, places, events, and artifacts that tell the story of those horrible days in April 1865. Taking listeners behind the scenes of his research, Swanson discusses the origins of his boyhood passion for Lincoln, including his first visits to Springfield, Illinois, and Ford’s Theatre as a high school student; accounts for Booth’s movements during the manhunt; reveals how he authenticates Lincoln blood relics; and offers details about historic sites that remain little-known or obscure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Swanson describes the intrigue he continues to pursue - the women who aided Booth, lingering questions regarding other conspirators, and a timeline for both Lincoln and the conspirators on the night of April 14, 1865.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Lincoln Obsession</i> is a uniquely personal look at how historical places and relics will forever shed new light on the first presidential assassination in America.&nbsp;</p>";
