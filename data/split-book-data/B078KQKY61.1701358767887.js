window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Washington Township, Michigan, on Valentine's Day, 2007, Stephen Grant filed a missing persons report on his beloved wife, Tara. The stay-at-home father of two was beside himself with despair. Why would Tara abandon him and their family? Was she involved with another man? </p> <p>Stephen's frantic, emotional search for Tara made national headlines, and the case was featured on <i>Dateline</i> among other television shows and news outlets. But key elements in Stephen's story still weren't adding up: Why did he wait five days to go to police? What was the nature of his relationship with his children's beautiful, 19-year-old babysitter? Why did Stephen have cuts on his hands, and random bruises? Then, the police made a gruesome discovery. </p> <p>Parts of Tara Grant's body started turning up around the woods near their home. The truth was finally coming to light...and, after a two-day manhunt, Stephen admitted to having killed Tara―first strangling her, then cutting her body into 14 pieces before burying them. This is the shocking true story about a bitter, cheating husband whose crimes were revealed by the <i>Blood in the Snow</i>. </p>";
