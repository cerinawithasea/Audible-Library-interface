window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The full inside story of the technology paradigm shift transforming the food we eat and who is making it</b></p> <p>Ultraprocessed and secretly produced foods are roaring back into vogue, cheered by consumers and investors because they are plant-based and help address societal issues.
