window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The biggest lie in history is about to be shattered. </p> <p>UFOs are real. In late June of 1947, three extraterrestrial craft were downed outside Roswell Air Force Base. Many more followed, revealing dozens of ET species and a Rosetta Stone to a new physics, an energy generation and propulsion system responsible for interstellar space travel. This new system could have easily replaced oil, gas, coal, and nuclear plants - and with them, the entire geopolitical and economic order on our planet. But a cabal of bankers, the military-industrial complex, and Big Oil stopped it. </p> <p>We have been lied to. And now, 70 years after Roswell, the witnesses to that lie have come forward to testify in a must-listen book that will shock the world. </p>";
