window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They might be our best friends, but we often have no idea what they are thinking. Peer inside the fascinating world of the mind of the dog with associate professor of psychology Ellen Furlong of Illinois Wesleyan University.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ever wonder how the same nose that always manages to find the worst-smelling place in the park to roll around can also be trained to sniff out cancer, bombs, and even endangered plants and animals? As you embark on a penetrating look at the canine brain, you’ll break down the unique ways dogs think and feel and investigate how they see the world around them - as well as how they smell it!&nbsp;</p> <p>Professor Furlong will unpack the evolution and domestication of dogs and explain why talking about how “smart” dogs are misses the point. She’ll dig into the special relationship dogs have with humans, both illuminating where it stemmed from and examining what dogs actually think of us.&nbsp;</p> <p>These insights will help you gain a much deeper understanding of and appreciation for your canine companion, and, by examining how dogs acted in the past, you might better grasp your modern dog’s perplexing, quirky behaviors. A better comprehension of your dog’s cognition, perception, and social relationships will help you build a stronger bond as well as improve your ability to work with your pup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’ve ever shaken your head at your puzzling pup while wondering “Why in the world does he do that?” this is your chance to get answers as you go inside the mind of your furry best friend.</p>";
