window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Mystery Solved</b></p> <p>In 1888, five gruesome murders shocked the civilized public. A bloodthirsty killer was on the loose in the slums of London. The world was on the lookout for Jack the Ripper.</p> <p>Scotland Yard never found their man - or so they said publicly. The police knew the killer's identity but concealed it to save the ruling class from embarrassment.</p> <p><i>The Escape of Jack the Ripper</i> reveals how British elites manipulated the public to protect one of their own. Through meticulous research, Jonathan Hainsworth and Christine Ward-Agius have uncovered the killer's identity.</p> <p>In <i>The Escape of Jack the Ripper</i>, you'll learn: how a fit of madness transformed a reputable gentleman into a savage murderer; that the killer was caught literally red-handed but talked his way out of police custody; about the decades-long cover-up by the press and the police to protect a well-to-do family's reputation; about the harrowing social conditions in which the murders took place; and how the social privileges enjoyed by the ruling class led to a miscarriage of justice. A thoroughly researched and gripping tale, <i>The Escape of Jack the Ripper</i> solves the great Whitechapel murder mystery once and for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
