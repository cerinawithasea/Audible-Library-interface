window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set on the Minnesota prairies in 1987, during a drought season that is fostering the demise of the family farms, the story features two intertwining narrators: a father searching for answers after his son commits a heinous murder, and a pastor's wife who has returned to the town for mysterious reasons of her own. A penetrating look at small-town America, reminiscent of Russell Banks' <i>Sweet Hereafter</i> or <i>Affliction,</i> driven by a powerful murder mystery, <i>Little Wolves</i> is a literary triumph.</p>";
