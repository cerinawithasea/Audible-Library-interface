window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Black girls and women disappear every day, but not without a trace. Join actress and activist Erika Alexander in a neo-noir, true crime drama as she searches for Tamika Huston, a 24-year-old Black woman from Spartanburg, SC who went missing in 2004. Her case became a rallying cry for other missing Black women in America and led to a growing demand to expose a system that ignores missing girls and women of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Kevin Hart and Charlamagne Tha God’s SBH productions present their debut Audible Original <i>Finding Tamika</i>. In it, host Erika Alexander summons a new generation to help raise the dead, expose a hidden past, and give a dark warning for our future. In <i>Finding Tamika</i>, what we’ll actually discover is the awful truth that a Black girl does not have to go missing for us not to see her. No matter the cost, though, we must look for Tamika, because until she is found, we are all lost.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Please Note: This content is for mature audiences only.
