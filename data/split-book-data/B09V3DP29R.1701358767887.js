window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the best-selling author of <i>The Last Mrs. Parrish</i> and Audible Original <i>The First Shot</i> comes an edge-of-your-seat novella of two women, the shocking betrayal that drove them apart, and a sinister secret that could change everything.&nbsp;</p> <p>Iris Thomas thought she’d never have to see Sasha Everett again after Sasha seduced her husband and broke up their marriage in a devastating betrayal. But as luck would have it, when Iris’ stepdaughter, Molly, and Sasha’s daughter, Bailey, wind up in the same second-grade class at an elite private school in Los Angeles, they form an instant bond and force the two women back into each other’s lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Iris wants to put the past behind her and support Molly, but as time goes on, she suspects that Sasha may be guilty of something even worse than adultery—of a crime so sinister, no one besides Iris thinks it’s possible. But Sasha’s fooled Iris once before. This time, can she uncover the truth before it’s too late?&nbsp;</p>";
