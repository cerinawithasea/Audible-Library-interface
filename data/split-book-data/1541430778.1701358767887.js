window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Japanese Mind</i>, Roger Davies offers Westerners an invaluable key to the unique aspects of Japanese culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Listeners of this book will gain a clear understanding of what makes the Japanese, and their society, tick. Among the topics explored: aimai (ambiguity), amae (dependence upon others' benevolence), amakudari (the nation's descent from heaven), chinmoku (silence in communication), gambari (perseverance), giri (social obligation), haragei (literally, \"belly art\"; implicit, unspoken communication), kenkyo (the appearance of modesty), sempai-kohai (seniority), wabi-sabi (simplicity and elegance), and zoto (gift giving), as well as discussions of child-rearing, personal space, and the roles of women in Japanese society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>All in all, this book is an easy-to-use introduction to the distinguishing characteristics of Japanese society; an invaluable resource for anyone - business people, travelers, or students - perfect for course adoption, but also for anyone interested in Japanese culture.</p>";
