window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A child disappears. A foster mother faces an impossible choice. A baby’s future hangs in the balance.</b></p> <p>When Deb Moerke and her husband decided to become foster parents, they never imagined how their lives would change. And <i>never</i> did they imagine their worst nightmare coming true: Their five-year-old foster daughter, Hannah, murdered at the hands of her birth mom, Karen.</p> <p>The Moerkes were overwhelmed with horror and grief. And just when they didn’t think they could bear any more, Deb received a phone call from Karen in prison. Facing a life sentence for Hannah’s murder, she was pregnant. And Karen had an incredible request: Would Deb take her unborn baby in and love it as her own?</p> <p>How would you respond? Could you show God’s love to someone who had hurt you and taken away everything you held dear?</p> <p><i>Murder, Motherhood, and Miraculous Grace</i> is an unbelievable true story of faith, family, and a journey toward seemingly impossible forgiveness. A story that tests the limits of the human heart, it’s ultimately a beautiful, life-affirming testament to how unconditional love and relentless obedience can transform even the darkest of nights into mornings of hope.</p>";
