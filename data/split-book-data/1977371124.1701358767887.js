window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling novel that inspired Mervyn LeRoy's classic horror film about the little girl who can get away with anything - even murder.</p> <p>There's something special about eight-year-old Rhoda Penmark. With her carefully plaited hair and her sweet cotton dresses, she's the very picture of old-fashioned innocence. But when their neighborhood suffers a series of terrible accidents, her mother begins to wonder: Why do bad things seem to happen when little Rhoda is around?</p> <p>Originally published in 1954, William March's final novel was an instant best seller and National Book Award finalist before it was adapted for the stage and made into a 1956 film. <i>The Bad Seed</i> is an indelible portrait of an evil that wears an innocent face, one which still resonates in popular culture today.</p>";
