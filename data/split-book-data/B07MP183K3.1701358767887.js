window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Charles Darwin's remarkable <i>On the Origin of Species</i> was a groundbreaking work that fundamentally altered how scientists approached the study of life itself. However, since its publication in 1859, the modern science of biology and genetics has added surprising new dimensions to evolutionary theory.</p> <p>In this course, you’ll discover what Darwin didn’t know, covering much of the curriculum of an introductory college course in evolutionary biology. No background in science is needed to follow these engaging lectures, delivered by Professor Scott Solomon of Rice University, a gifted teacher and widely traveled field biologist.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Solomon reveals how the many gaps and mysteries in the evolutionary theory of Darwin’s day were systematically solved by brilliant researchers, such as Gregor Mendel, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, Motoo Kimura, and a host of others, who have brought the world into a golden age of biological research.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your lessons begin by laying the foundation of Darwin’s theory. Then, you’ll move forward in time, and hear how advances in genetics, molecular biology, paleontology, and even geology have given Darwin’s ideas more depth, and in some cases, turned them on their heads. You’ll uncover how DNA reconstruction has allowed us to gain a clearer picture of evolutionary history and explore the vital role of heredity in the millions of species known today - including species Darwin himself never even dreamed would exist. Throughout these lectures, you’ll apply modern evolutionary theory to better understand the breeding of plants, animals, and genetically modified organisms. Finally, you’ll hear how the cutting-edge science of gene editing is being used to influence evolution, and you’ll peer into the future to gauge the prospects for further evolution of our own species.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
