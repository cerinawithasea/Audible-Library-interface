window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1992, nine-year-old Katie Beers was kidnapped by a family friend and locked in an underground box for 17 days. Katie has now come forward to tell the story that created a national media storm as reporters uncovered the truth about her prekidnapping life of neglect and sexual abuse and the details of her rescue. She shares how this experience and the recent death of her kidnapper, John Esposito, has affected her life. Despite the horrible reality of Katie's days of being chained in darkness, the kidnapping was, in fact, the climactic end of a tragic childhood and the beginning of a new life. Katie breaks her silence and reveals her inspiring healing process to the journalist who covered the story of the disappearance more than 20 years ago. </p> <p><i>Buried Memories</i> is the only source that includes the complete details of her traumatic childhood, transcriptions of recordings from Esposito, a firsthand account of how Katie felt after Esposito's death in 2013, and Katie's hopeful view of the future as she looks back into her dark past. </p>";
