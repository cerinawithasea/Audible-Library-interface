window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The dramatic story of the unlikely partnership that led to Hybrid Theory, the biggest-selling debut album of the 21st century.</b></p> <p>From the unique perspective of the executive who discovered them, <i>One Step Closer</i> reveals how Brad Delson's college internship was a catalyst for a group of young musical visionaries, led by Mike Shinoda, which gave rise to a band that survived countless rejections, exceeded everyone's expectations but their own, and became the voice of a generation.</p> <p>This against-all-odds story chronicles the early days of Linkin Park, from their first demo and Whisky a Go Go performance as Xero, through their tireless efforts to perfect their iconic sound and the discovery of Chester Bennington. Jeff Blue was there when no one else believed - first as their publisher, then as their A-and-R guy. This is his memoir of that incredible journey.</p> <p>Riveting and inspiring,<i> One Step Closer</i> is a testament to perseverance, as well as a detailed behind-the-scenes account of the building of a dream and what it takes to make it.</p>";
