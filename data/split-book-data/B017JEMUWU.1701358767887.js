window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Blood of Others</i> received one of the world's top literary prizes for crime fiction, the 2003 Arthur Ellis Award, given by the Crime Writers of Canada for Best Novel. In his praise of the book, James Patterson, the number-one worldwide best-selling author, said <i>Blood of Others</i> was \"tense, realistic, and scary in all the right places\". </p> <p>The disappearance and murder of a lonely San Francisco insurance clerk puts a relentless crime reporter and a legendary homicide cop on separate tracks in their pursuit of a killer. The suspect lures solitary women out of their quiet worlds and into his nightmare as he races the clock and travels the globe searching for the one woman who will forgive the unforgivable. In the course of a widening investigation, Olivia Grant, a shy gift store sales manager who aches to escape her painful solitude, meets Ben Wyatt, an outcast San Francisco cop on the case. Wyatt is a man gripped with self-doubt over the shooting of his former partner. </p> <p><i>Blood of Others</i> is a study of loneliness and human frailties; a story steeped in terrifying suspense that threatens to destroy the lives of those drawn into it as it rockets to a heart-pounding conclusion. </p>";
