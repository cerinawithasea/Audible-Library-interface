window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this original and riveting exploration, Susan Jacoby argues that conversion - especially in the free American \"religious marketplace\" - is too often viewed only within the conventional and simplistic narrative of personal reinvention and divine grace. Instead, the author places conversions within a secular social context that has, at various times, included the force of a unified church and state, desire for upward economic mobility, and interreligious marriage. </p> <p>Moving through time, continents, and cultures, Jacoby examines conversions to authoritarian secular ideologies. She also provides portraits of individual converts, including the Catholic Church father Augustine of Hippo; the German Jewish convert to Catholicism Edith Stein, murdered at Auschwitz and canonized by the church; boxing champion Muhammad Ali, who scandalized white Americans in the 1960s by becoming a Muslim; and even politicians such as George W. Bush. Finally, Jacoby takes on the question of why the freedom to choose a religion - or to reject religion altogether - is a fundamental human rights issue that remains a breeding ground for violence in areas of the world that never experienced an Enlightenment. </p>";
