window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In June 2004, 16-year-old Liam Kelly was lured to a location in Liverpool in the early hours of one morning and shot dead. The following year, another Liverpudlian, 22-year-old mother of three Lucy Hargreaves, was shot dead in her own home. Her partner and their two-year-old daughter escaped after the house was set alight by leaping from a first-floor bedroom window.&nbsp;</p> <p>For more than 15 years, six-foot six-inch, broadly built, ginger-haired Kevin Parle has been wanted by the police for both murders. How could he have evaded national and international crime investigators for so long? Who is harbouring him?&nbsp;</p> <p>Author and former Scotland Yard detective and undercover cop Peter Bleksley is determined to find the answers. He has immersed himself again in the world of serious and organised crime, this time armed only with a pen, a notebook and a mobile phone. He has vowed not to rest until Parle is found.</p> <p>This gripping story goes behind the scenes of the hit BBC Sounds podcast <i>Manhunt: Finding Kevin Parle</i>.&nbsp;</p>";
