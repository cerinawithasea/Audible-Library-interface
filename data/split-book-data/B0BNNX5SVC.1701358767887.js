window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Best-selling author James Patterson and award-winning sportswriter Mike Lupica team up to launch this power-family football thriller, a pre-game for their next blockbuster, <i>The House of Wolves</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Meet the Wolf. Joe Wolf. He’s the head of a multibillion-dollar empire—a newspaper, a holding company, a football team—and the head of a family that puts King Lear to shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>His empire shows signs of crumbling when he’s approached with an “offer” to sell. It’s clear from the start that Joe is going to pay the ultimate price—and maybe more—if he refuses.</p>";
