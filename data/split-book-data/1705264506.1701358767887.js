window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this substantially expanded edition of his earlier book<i> The Monster at Our Door</i>, the renowned activist and author Mike Davis looks at the COVID-19 pandemic now sweeping the world. He sets the current crisis in the context of previous viral catastrophes, notably the 1918 influenza disaster that killed at least 40 million people in three months and the avian flu of a decade and a half ago that sounded a tocsin, disastrously ignored by those in power, for today's devastating outbreak.</p> <p>In language both accessible and authoritative, <i>The Monster Enters</i> surveys the scientific and political roots of today's viral apocalypse. In doing so, it exposes the key roles of agribusiness and the fast-food industries, abetted by corrupt governments and a capitalist global system careening out of control, in creating the ecological preconditions for a plague that has brought much of human existence to a juddering halt.</p>";
