window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Savage Beauty </i></b><b>is the portrait of a passionate, fearless woman who obsessed America even as she tormented herself.</b></p> <p>If F. Scott Fitzgerald was the hero of the Jazz Age, Edna St. Vincent Millay, as flamboyant in her love affairs as she was in her art, was its heroine. A winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Millay was dazzling in the performance of herself. Her voice was likened to an instrument of seduction, and her impact on crowds and on men was legendary. Yet beneath her studied act, all was not well.</p> <p>Milford calls her book “a family romance\" - for the love between the three Millay sisters and their mother was so deep as to be dangerous. As a family, they were like real-life <i>Little Women</i>, with a touch of <i>Mommie Dearest</i>.</p> <p>Nancy Milford was given exclusive access to Millay’s papers, and what she found was an extraordinary treasure. Boxes and boxes of letters flew back and forth among the three sisters and their mother - and Millay kept the most intimate diary, one whose ruthless honesty brings to mind Sylvia Plath.</p> <p>Written with passion and flair, <i>Savage Beauty</i> is an iconic portrait of a woman’s life.</p>";
