He lived in a quiet neighborhood with his wife and family, drove a Volvo, and practiced dentistry in Philadelphia. But, from 1978 to 1984 Dr. Lavin moonlighted as one of the largest cocaine kingpins on the Eastern seaboard. Through the voices and perspectives of law enforcement, drug runners, friends, business associates, and Larry Lavin himself, Wolves Among Us tells the story of Lavin’s dual life, his impact on Philadelphia culture in the late 70s and early 80s, and the stunning events that led to an intense manhunt for one of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives.
