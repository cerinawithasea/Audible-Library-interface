window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Inarguably one of the greatest dramas in the history of the American theater” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>), Eugene O'Neill’s <i>Long Day's Journey into Night</i> receives a vibrant and timely update in this interpretation by prolific, Tony Award(R)-nominated director Robert O’Hara (Slave Play). At the heart of O’Neill’s masterwork is the Tyrone family, living together again under lockdown. As the pressure builds, each family member retreats to their own destructive vices. This must see production inspired by the events of 2020 is a visceral and provocative exploration of addiction and mental health speaking to our present moment. Starring Emmy(R) Award-nominee Bill Camp (<i>The Crucible</i>, <i>The Queen’s Gambit</i>), three-time Obie Award(R)-winner Elizabeth Marvel (<i>Hedda Gabler</i>, <i>Homeland</i>), Tony Award-nominee Ato Blankson-Wood (<i>Slave Play</i>), and Jason Bowen (<i>The Play That Goes Wrong</i>).&nbsp;</p>";
