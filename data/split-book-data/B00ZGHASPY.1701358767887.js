window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From R. Barri Flowers, award-winning criminologist and international best-selling author of the true crime classic <i>The Sex Slave Murders</i>, comes a gripping new true crime short, \"Terror in East Lansing: The Tale of MSU Serial Killer Donald Miller\". In the late 1970s, a serial killer prowled the campus of Michigan State University, terrorizing students and faculty alike. Donald Miller was a graduate of MSU's renowned School of Criminal Justice, but somehow went awry and turned into a monster, targeting pretty coeds for sexual assault and murder. Miller's victims included his ex-fianc√©e. Only after the killer was brought to justice could the campus return to normal, as a place for education and enjoyment. Donald Miller's path from promising criminal justice grad to deadly criminal is chronicled in this riveting short. </p> <p>Included is a complete second story, \"The Midwest Murders\". This is the shocking tale of serial killer couple Alton Coleman and Debra Denise Brown, who went on a killing spree across four Midwestern states during the summer of 1984, showing no mercy to those in their murderous path. </p><p>Bonus material includes excerpts from R. Barri Flowers' best-selling true crime book, <i>The Sex Slave Murders: The True Story of Serial Killers Gerald &amp; Charlene Gallego</i>, and top-selling true crime shorts \"The Sex Slave Murders 3: The Horrific Tale of Serial Killers Leonard Lake &amp; Charles Ng\" and \"The Amityville Massacre: The DeFeo Family's Nightmare\". </p>";
