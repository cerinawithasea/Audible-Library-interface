window.bookSummaryJSON = "Season 2 - Panic Button: Operation Wildfire *trigger ⚠️ warning* Mark your calendars for the podcast release of the summer. Come with us on a journey through rural Oklahoma, on the backroads and through the courthouses as we track a serial domestic abuser who is still out there. One person with a trail of victims as long as Boston Pool Road winding all the way back to 1997. What will it take for a punitive system to hold a known violent offender accountable? So many folks said that April Wilkens should have held back, should not have shot so many times, should have left. But what happens when an abuser is left unchecked in Oklahoma? Women are getting life sentences for fighting back — but men go on to abuse with impunity. Join us for this multi-part serial podcast to be released June 27th, 2023. Listen wherever you get your podcasts.";
