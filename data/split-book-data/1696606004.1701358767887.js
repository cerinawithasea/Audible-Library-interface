window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If there had been no cover-up of Robert Kennedy's complicity in the murder of Marilyn Monroe in 1962 and he had been prosecuted based on compelling evidence at the time, the assassination of JFK by Bobby's enemies would not have happened - changing the course of history and preventing the murder of media icon Dorothy Kilgallen.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a breakthrough book that is sure to be relevant for years to come, best-selling author (<i>The Reporter Who Knew Too Much</i>) and distinguished historian Mark Shaw investigates the connection between the mysterious deaths of motion picture screen siren Marilyn Monroe, President John F. Kennedy, and <i>What's My Line? </i>TV star and crack investigative reporter Dorothy Kilgallen. A former noted criminal defense attorney and network legal analyst, Shaw provides an illuminating perspective as to how Robert Kennedy's abuse of power during the early 1960s resulted in the murders of Marilyn, JFK, and Dorothy.</p>";
