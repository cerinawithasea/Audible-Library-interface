window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Step into the wild.</p> <p>Age thirty-eight and feeling every day of it, Katherine May sets out to walk the 630-mile South West Coast Path. Determined to reconnect with her sense of self and rediscover her love of nature, she seeks to understand why everyday life can feel overwhelming and isolating; why sensory environments can become all-consuming and why normality seems to involve social expectations that are exhausting. As she begins her journey, answers begin to unfold—starting with a chance encounter with a voice on the radio that sparks the realisation that she may be autistic. Katherine’s walking becomes a process of both psychological and physical exploration and moments of discovery as she navigates and re-evaluates her life so far.</p> <p>An immersive audio drama based on the original memoir <i>The Electricity of Every Living Thing</i> by Katherine May. This series compels you to walk with Katherine on her journey along the line of the South West Coast. In this adaptation, Katherine’s story is recreated as an immersive sensory journey detailing a different way of being in the world -and becomes a different way of experiencing an audio drama.</p> <p>Director: Caitriona Shoobridge</p> <p>Adapted by: Julie Parsons</p> <p>Consultant: Nicola Shaughnessy</p> <p>Producer: Anishka Sharma</p> <p>Production Team: Calum Perrin, Kate Lee, Tom Brignell, Nigel Appleton.</p> <p>A Whistledown Production for Audible Originals UK.</p> <p>Link to further resources: katherine-may.co.uk/autism-resource-page <br> <br> <b>*Audible takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by third parties*</b></p> <p>This series is an adaptation of an original memoir by Katherine May. The story is recreated as an immersive audio drama that details a different way of being in the world—and is a different way of experiencing an audio drama. You can listen either on speakers or by using headphones. Each way of listening provides a different experience. We encourage listeners to try both and settle on the one best for you.</p> <p>This dramatisation contains content listeners may find sensitive or distressing, reflecting the author’s account of autistic experience. This includes references to bullying, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, melt-downs, medical language and negative attitudes towards neurodivergent/autistic people. There are also some scenes conveying the acuity of sensory experience which may be triggering. The techniques can be intensive, so we encourage listeners to be aware of this when choosing where and when to experience the piece.</p> <p>Starring Amy McAllister, Alex Austin, Debra Baker, Laurie Brett, Saffron Coomber, Jason Forbes, Raj Ghatak, Peter Gold, Akiya Henry, Veera Lapinkoski, Yasmin Mwanza, Sid Sagar, Maya Saroya, Clement Stokes and Milo Twomey</p>";
