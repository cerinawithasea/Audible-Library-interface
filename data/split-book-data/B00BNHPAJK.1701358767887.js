window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alex was Ian's five-year-old son: brilliant, earnest, and compassionate. He is dead now, but Ian can't let him go. When his wife urges him to move on, he drives her away. His performance at work collapses; his friends leave him. Six months later, alone in an empty house, Ian starts to see his son again. </p> <p>Every vision is a repeat of something the boy said or did in life: aching memories replaying themselves for Ian's eyes alone. Are these images of Alex real? Has Ian's son found a way back, to forgive or condemn his father? Or has Ian's sorrow metastasized into psychosis? </p> <p>With a masterful hand, best-selling Kindle Horror author Adam J. Nicolai paints a picture of grief, madness, and the furious strength of a father's love for his son.</p>";
