window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>That's Mental </i>breaks down myths and misconceptions about what it means to be a millennial with mental illness in a darkly funny, but relatable way. In her new book, Rosenberg addresses the overlooked and offbeat issues of mental illness, shedding light on topics that are off limits, uncomfortable, or just downright embarrassing. This book details every challenging and awkward stage of Amanda's journey with mental illness and how she manages what she calls her \"garden variety crazy.\"</p> <p>\"I'm writing this book because it's important, because people need a laugh, and because it's the book I wish I'd read before I lost my entire mind,\" explains Rosenberg. \"It's everything that drives me crazy about being crazy,\" she says.</p> <p>Rosenberg hopes her book stands to be a voice for millenials, a generation who, for the most part, are overworked, underpaid, and yet broadly labeled as spoiled brats. This candid and deeply revealing look into mental illness is filled with confessional essays about the inappropriate, devastating, and strangely amusing side to being mentally ill.</p>";
