window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bradford Bishop had it all: a beautiful wife, three towhead sons, a nice home in a quiet Maryland suburb, and a promising career in the US State Department. But on March 1, 1976, he threw it all away. After finding out he'd been passed over for a promotion, Bishop snapped. He went home and, in an act of unspeakable brutality, murdered his wife, his three boys, and his own mother - five people in all. Then he vanished off the face of the Earth. Or so it seemed. </p><p>Almost 40 years later, Peter Ross Range (author of the best-selling <i>Murder in the Yoga Store</i>) delivers the definitive story of Bishop's life and crime, following the trail from his privileged upbringing in California to his wily escape, including never-before reported details and chilling theories as to where he might be today. </p>";
