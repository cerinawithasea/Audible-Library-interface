window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you believe the news, today's America is plagued by an epidemic of violent hate crimes.</p> <p>But is that really true?</p> <p>In <i>Hate Crime Hoax</i>, professor Wilfred Reilly examines over 100 widely publicized incidents of so-called hate crimes that never actually happened. With a critical eye and attention to detail, Reilly debunks these fabricated incidents - many of them alleged to have happened on college campuses - and explores why so many Americans are driven to fake hate crimes. We're not experiencing an epidemic of hate crimes, Reilly concludes - but we might be experiencing an unprecedented epidemic of hate crime <i>hoaxes</i>.</p>";
