window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"After four, I quit counting. What's the point if you know it isn't going to stop?\" </b></p> <p>Sadie is jealous. Why wouldn't she be? Her life is falling apart. Meanwhile, her new neighbor is everything she is not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Ann is perfect-the kind of woman everyone loves to hate-and a best friend to die for. She hosts over-the-top dinner parties, takes parenting to an entirely different level, and makes ambition look sexy as hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Sadie learns quick: the best way to cure jealousy is to befriend it. She also learns there's more to her new friend than meets the eye. She's patient, she's kind, and possibly a serial killer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It isn't until Ann's proclivities hit a little too close to home that Sadie has to ask herself how much she's willing to overlook in the name of getting what she wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Exquisitely paced, Her is an unnerving and electrifying psychological thriller about jealousy, passion, and the dangerous places desire can take you. Full of enough tension and twists to make even the most seasoned suspense listener break out in a cold sweat, it keeps you guessing until the very end.</p>";
