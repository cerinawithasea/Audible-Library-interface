window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>East Antarctica: the coldest, most desolate location on earth. Two-and-a-half miles below the ice cap is Vostok, a 6,000 square mile liquid lake, over 1,000 feet deep, left untouched for more than 15 million years. Now, marine biologist Zachary Wallace and two other scientists aboard a submersible tethered to a laser will journey 13,000 feet beneath the ice into this unexplored realm to discover Mesozoic life-forms long believed extinct - and an object of immense power responsible for the evolution of modern man. </p> <p>In this sequel to <i>The Loch</i> and prequel to <i>Meg: Nightstalkers</i>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Steve Alten offers listeners a crossover novel that features characters from two of his most popular series. </p>";
