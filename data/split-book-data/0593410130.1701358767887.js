window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Who hasn't wondered what alternate versions of their lives might look like? ... As relatable as it is suspenseful cleverly&nbsp;exploring adulthood, identity, and shifting realities.” (Margarita Montimore, </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Oona Out of Order</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>An inventive pause-resister about the choices we make and the ones made for us.</b></p> <p>One minute, Kelly’s a free-spirited artist in Chicago going to her best friend’s art show. The next, she opens a door and mysteriously emerges in her Michigan hometown. Suddenly her life is unrecognizable: She's got 12 years of the wrong memories in her head and she's married to Eric, a man she barely knew in high school.</p> <p>Racing to get back to her old life, Kelly's search leads only to more questions. In this life, she loves Eric and wants to trust him, but everything she discovers about him - including a connection to a mysterious tech start-up - tells her she shouldn't. And strange things keep happening. The tattoos she had when she was an artist briefly reappear on her skin, she remembers fights with Eric that he says never happened, and her relationships with loved ones both new and familiar seem to change without warning.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the closer Kelly gets to putting the pieces together, the more her reality seems to shift. And if she can't figure out what happened on her birthday, the next change could cost her everything...</p>";
