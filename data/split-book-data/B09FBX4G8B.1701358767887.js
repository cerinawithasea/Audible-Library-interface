window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Leftöver Crack is a band of drug-abusing, dumpster-diving, cop-hating, queer-positive, pro-choice crust punks who successfully blend ska-punk, pop, hip-hop, and death metal genres. They've been banned from clubs, states, and counties and kicked off multiple record labels. They've received teen-idol adoration and death threats from their fans. They've played benefits for a multitude of causes while leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.</p> <p>But if you dig below the crusty, black-metal-patch-encased surface, you'll find a contemplative, nuanced band that, quite literally, permanently changed the punk rock community. By combining catchy ska-punk with lyrics that referenced political theorist Michael Parenti, drug usage, and suicide, the band formed a unique melange that was both provocative and challenging. In fact, the band's hooks were so sharp that after releasing their debut LP, <i>Mediocre Generica</i>, an entire culture of \"Crack City Rockers\" grew around the band, pushing the youth toward both the positive and negative aspects of extreme punk rock.</p> <p><i>Architects of Self-Destruction: An Oral History of Leftöver Crack</i> traces the band's entire history by speaking to the band members themselves, fellow musicians, their fans, and of course, those that still hold a grudge against the LoC.... FYI, that's a lot of people.</p>";
