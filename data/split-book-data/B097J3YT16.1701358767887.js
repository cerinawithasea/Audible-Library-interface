window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A stunningly lyrical firsthand account of a life spent hunting, studying, and living alongside caribou,&nbsp;<i>A Thousand Trails Home</i>&nbsp;encompasses the historical past and present day, revealing the fragile intertwined lives of people and animals surviving on an uncertain landscape of cultural and climatic change sweeping the Alaskan Arctic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Author Seth Kantner vividly illuminates this critical story about the interconnectedness of the IÃ±upiat of Northwest Alaska, the Western Arctic caribou herd, and the larger Arctic region. This story has global relevance as it takes place in one of the largest remaining intact wilderness ecosystems on the planet, ground zero for climate change in the US.&nbsp;</p> <p>This compelling and complex tale revolves around the politics of caribou, race relations, urban vs. rural demands, subsistence vs. sport hunting, and cultural priorities vs. resource extraction - a story that requires a fearless writer with an honest voice and an open heart.</p>";
