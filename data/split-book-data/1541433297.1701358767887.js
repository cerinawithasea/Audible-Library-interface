window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>World renowned scientist, Dr. Gerald Pollack, takes us on a fantastic voyage through water, showing us a hidden universe teeming with physical activity - providing simple explanations for common everyday phenomena, which you have inevitably seen but not really understood.</p> <p>For instance, have you ever wondered...</p> <p>How do clouds made up of dense water droplets manage to float in the sky? Why don't your joints squeak as they rub together? Why do you sink in dry sand, but not in wet sand? How does capillary action manage to raise water up a 100 foot tree? Why does warm water freeze quicker than cool water?</p> <p>Pollack uses a recent and fundamental scientific finding - EZ water - to help explain these and many other head-scratchers.</p> <p>When touching most surfaces, water transforms itself into so-called EZ (Exclusion Zone) water, also known as structured water or fourth phase water. EZ water, whose formula is H3O2, differs dramatically from H2O. And, there is a lot of it, everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This award-winning book provides ample evidence for the existence of EZ water. Pollack writes in a clear, eloquent style.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
