window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the mind of the man Stephen King calls \"a master of the macabre\", comes a brilliant new collection of no-punches-pulled horror stories, some never-before-collected and many originals that have never been published anywhere before. Bentley Little can take the innocuous, twist it around, and write a story that will change your way of thinking. <i>Walking Alone: Short Stories</i> is a shining example of his talent to scare you, creep you out, and make you shudder.</p>";
