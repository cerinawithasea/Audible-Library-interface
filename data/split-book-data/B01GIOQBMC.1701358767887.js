window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set against the turbulent backdrop of American vaudeville, four sisters embark on an unexpected adventure - and a last-ditch effort to save their family. </p> <p>In 1919 the Turner sisters and their parents are barely scraping by. Their father is a low-paid boot stitcher in Johnson City, New York, and the family is always one paycheck away from eviction. When their father's hand is crushed and he can no longer work, their irrepressible mother decides that the vaudeville stage is their best - and only - chance for survival. </p> <p>Traveling by train from town to town, teenagers Gert, Winnie, and Kit and recent widow Nell soon find a new kind of freedom in the company of performers who are as diverse as their acts. There is a seamier side to the business, however, and the young women face dangers and turns of fate they never could have anticipated. </p> <p>Heartwarming and surprising, <i>The Tumbling Turner Sisters</i> is ultimately a story of awakening - to unexpected possibilities, to love and heartbreak, and to the dawn of a new American era. </p>";
