window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Anxiety - it's the worst: choking, stifling, smothering, tingling, panicking, brain cutting out, bad decisions. You're a human being, so you know exactly what's being said here.</p> <p>Dr. Faith Harper lays it all out: what anxiety is, what it's good for - that's right, it's actually a necessary response that helps to keep us alive in bad situations - how to know when it's gone overboard, and practical tips on how to deal with it when it gets bad. This book is a lifesaver for panic attacks, breaking out of flight-or-fight-or-freeze responses, and for chronic anxiety. It's also good for folks who aren't daily burdened by anxiety, but want to better cope with those tough situations that affect us all. Listen to this and breathe!</p>";
