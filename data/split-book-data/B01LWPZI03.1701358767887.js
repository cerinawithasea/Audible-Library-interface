window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>M is a magician of modest wit, dim ability, and few scruples, who would prefer to spend his easy immortality drinking artisanal beer and making eyes at smiling women. Alas, in the infinite nexus of the universe that is New York City, equilibrium is no easy thing to maintain. Canal pirates, drug-induced divinities, pocket steam-punk universes, hipster zombies, ex-girlfriends, and the devil are all taken in easy stride - but when the city's uneasy dual monarchy threatens to break into outright war, it will take all of M's cleverness to keep the capital of existence from going the way of Atlantis. </p> <p>He might even have to get out of bed before noon. </p> <p>Sharp, surreal, and hilarious, <i>A City Dreaming</i> is the postmodern fantasy adventure you never saw coming. </p>";
