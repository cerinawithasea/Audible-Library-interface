window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Amazon Charts bestseller</b></p> <p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Alice Hoffman comes a heartfelt short story about family, independence, and finding your place in the world.</b></p> <p>Isabel Gibson has all but perfected the art of forgetting. She’s a New Yorker now, with nothing left to tie her to Brinkley’s Island, Maine. Her parents are gone, the family bookstore is all but bankrupt, and her sister, Sophie, will probably never speak to her again.</p> <p>But when a mysterious letter arrives in her mailbox, Isabel feels herself drawn to the past. After years of fighting for her independence, she dreads the thought of going back to the island. What she finds there may forever alter her path—and change everything she thought she knew about her family, her home, and herself.</p>";
