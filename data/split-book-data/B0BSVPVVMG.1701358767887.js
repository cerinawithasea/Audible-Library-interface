window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michelle Rojas is not okay. In fact, she’s burnt out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With a PsyD from Yale and a job at a renowned Connecticut therapy practice, Dominican psychologist Michelle Rojas is a Washington Heights success story. When she gets fired for lashing out at co-workers and giving patients questionable advice, Michelle returns home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Ashamed yet bullish, she lies to her family and friends: Michelle—voiced by Dascha Polanco (<i>Orange is the New Black</i>, <i>Samaritan</i>)—opens a therapy practice in a local bodega under the false pretense of expanding the therapy practice from Connecticut to New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But where she’s from, people just don’t go to therapy. It’s a struggle to pierce the tough resistance from the community, even with support from her free-spirited cousin Dora (Darlene Demorizi) and her quick-witted childhood friend Niño (The Kid Mero).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Michelle Rojas Is Not Okay</i> follows Michelle as she struggles to grapple with both her professional and personal identities. Throughout her journey, she faces setback after setback before it slowly becomes clear that she’s there not only to offer help to her community, but also to receive it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Michelle Rojas is not okay, but will she be?</p>";
