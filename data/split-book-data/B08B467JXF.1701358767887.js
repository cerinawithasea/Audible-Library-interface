window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The 16th century was a time of immense change across the globe. For many historians, it marks a massive shift in the way the world operated; it is often considered the beginning of modernity. We may regard the 16th century as the time of Shakespeare and the conquistadors, but women also played a powerful role in many of the major events around the world.</p> <p>In <i>10 Women Who Ruled the Renaissance</i>, you will explore the lives of 10 extraordinary women who exemplified the spirit of the 1500s - an era dominated by adventure, discovery, and cross-cultural exchange. As you learn their stories, you will witness the landing of the Spanish in Mexico, travel across the steppes of Asia, sail on ships off the coast of Africa, and visit the courts of European power. From patrons and pirates to witches and wanderers, you will meet the women who helped to shape the modern world in their own unique ways. Some of these women, like Malinche of the Aztecs, have complicated legacies that demonstrate how the basic drive for survival shaped so much of human history. Although you may be familiar with larger-than-life figures like Queen Elizabeth I, many of these extraordinary women may be new to you.</p> <p>Throughout this course, you will meet the individuals who broke with tradition to seek fame, wield power, and foster emerging artistic movements reflecting bold new ideas. At the same time, you will learn how a global commercial revolution brought unimagined wealth, changing rigid social structures that had been in place for hundreds of years. As you learn about women like Agnes Waterhouse, Ma Shouzen, Abbakka, and others, you will see a side of Renaissance life that textbooks often ignore, and you will come away with new respect for the trail-blazing women who have made their mark upon the world.&nbsp;</p>";
