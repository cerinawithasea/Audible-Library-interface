window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Bianca appears late one night at her brother’s house in Santa Ana, she is barely conscious, though not alone. Jubilee, wrapped in a fuzzy pink romper, is buckled into a car seat. Jubilee, who Bianca feeds and clothes and bathes and loves. Jubilee, who Bianca could not leave behind. Jubilee, a doll in her arms.</p> <p>Told in alternating points of view, <i>Jubilee</i> reveals both the haunting power of our lived experiences and the surreal possibility of the present to heal the past.</p> <p>The first thread, “Before Jubilee”, follows Bianca in her girlhood home on the Mexicali border as she struggles with her high school sweetheart, Gabe, and a secret they’ve shared since she was 15.</p> <p>The second thread, “With Jubilee”, is told from the point of view of her new love, Joshua, who, along with Bianca’s family, helps her cope with a mysterious trauma by accepting Jubilee as part of the family. As Joshua’s love for Bianca grows, he fears that Jubilee has the power to tear his tiny family apart.</p> <p>Alternating chapters give listeners a unique perspective on Bianca’s present and on her relationship with Jubilee as her past life with Gabe comes to a catastrophic end.</p> <p><i>Jubilee</i> is at once a darkly suspenseful psychological drama and a luminous reflection on how beauty emerges from even the most traumatic of experiences.</p>";
