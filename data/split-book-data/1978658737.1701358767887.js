Then, one September night, thirty-year-old Nance pushed his luck, preying on a couple who lived to tell the tale.</p> <p>A true story with an incredible twist, written by former <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editor John Coston and complete with photos, <i>To Kill and Kill Again</i> reveals the disturbing compulsions of a charming serial killer who fooled everyone he knew, stumped the authorities, terrified a community, and nearly got away with it.</p>";
