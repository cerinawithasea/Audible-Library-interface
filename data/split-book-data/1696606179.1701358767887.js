window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A fascinating psychological study of an unrepentant murderer\" from a New York Times best-selling author (</b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p>Battle Creek, Michigan, is famous as the birthplace of breakfast cereal, and the nearby suburb of Marshall is as wholesome as shredded wheat. Well-known for its colorful Victorian mansions, this stately slice of 19th-century Americana became infamous on a frigid night in February of 1991. Newscaster Diane Newton King was stepping out of her car, her children strapped into the backseat, when a sniper's bullet cut her down. The police assumed that the killer was her stalker - a crazed fan who had been terrorizing King for weeks. But as their investigation ground to a standstill, the police turned to another suspect - one much closer to home.</p> <p>In this gripping retelling of the crime and its aftermath, journalist Lowell Cauffiel recreates the atmosphere of terror that marked King's last days, giving us a story of celebrity, obsession, and what it means to kill.</p>";
