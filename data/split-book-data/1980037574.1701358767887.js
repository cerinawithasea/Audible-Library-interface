window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An evocative multigenerational Cuban-American family story of revolution, loss, and family bonds. </b></p> <p>Marisol vanished during the Cuban Revolution, disappearing with hardly a trace. Now, shaped by atrocities long-forgotten, her foul-mouthed spirit visits her nephew, Ramon, in modern-day New Jersey. Her hope: That her presence will prompt him to unearth their painful family history.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ramon launches a haphazard investigation into the story of his ancestor, unaware of the forces driving him on his search. Along the way, he falls in love, faces a run-in with a murderous gangster, and uncovers the lives of the lost saints who helped Marisol during her imprisonment.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Book of Lost Saints </i>by Daniel Jose Older is a haunting meditation on family, forgiveness, and the violent struggle to be free.</p>";
