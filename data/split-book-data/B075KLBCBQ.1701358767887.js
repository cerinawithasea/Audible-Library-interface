window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Aurelie Harcourt's father dies in debtor's prison, he leaves her just two things: his wealthy family, whom she has never met, and his famous pen name, Nathaniel Droll. Her new family greets her with apathy and even resentment. Only the quiet houseguest, Silas Rotherham, welcomes her company. </p> <p>When Aurelie decides to complete her father's unfinished serial novel, writing the family into the story as unflattering characters, she must keep her identity as Nathaniel Droll hidden while searching for the truth about her mother's disappearance - and perhaps even her father's death. </p> <p>Author Joanna Davidson Politano's stunning debut set in Victorian England will delight listeners with its highly original plot, lush setting, vibrant characters, and reluctant romance. </p>";
