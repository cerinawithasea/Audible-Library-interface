window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something strange is in your neighborhood, your bedroom, your body. Are ghosts haunted by the living? Is possession ever good? Are there strangers in the shadows—just like you—altering reality with dark, peculiar urges?</p> <p>Meet the members of the Equinox Society: Claire, a caustic but compassionate demonologist; Amanda, a witch who wants to help; William, an occultist living in a haunted brownstone; and other ordinary people who share a fascination with the bizarre and otherworldly.</p> <p>Their reports explore private fears and personal demons, offering glimpses of the nightscape all of us inhabit. A troubled vampire who stalks an abandoned shopping mall. A dead teen who emails from the past. An arsonist who starts real fires with her dreams.</p> <p><i>My Heart Is Full of Blood</i> is an unflinching yet oddly optimistic collection of short horror fiction.</p>";
