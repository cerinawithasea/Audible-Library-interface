window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>By turns hilarious and heartbreaking, <i>Walking with Ghosts</i> is a delightful portrait of the people and landscapes that ultimately shape our destinies. A Landmark production, it came to Broadway direct from highly acclaimed runs in London’s West End; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Dublin, Ireland.</p> <p>As a young boy growing up on the outskirts of Dublin, the stage and screen legend sought refuge in a world of imagination among the fields and hills near his home, at the edge of a rapidly encroaching city. Moving between sensual recollection of childhood in a now almost vanished Ireland and commentary on stardom, the actor-writer returned to Broadway and Audible to reflect on a life’s journey.</p> <p>Adapted from his best-selling memoir of the same name and directed by Emmy Award® winner Lonny Price (<i>Sunset Boulevard</i>, <i>Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill</i>), <i>Walking with Ghosts</i> is written and performed by the “spellbinding” (<i>The Times</i>) Gabriel Byrne (<i>Hereditary</i>, HBO’s <i>In Treatment</i>).</p>";
