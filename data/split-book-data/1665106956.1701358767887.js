window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>A Boob’s Life</i></b><b> explores the surprising truth about women’s most popular body part with vulnerable, witty frankness and true nuggets of American culture that will resonate with everyone who has breasts - or loves them. </b></p> <p>Author Leslie Lehr wants to talk about boobs. She’s gone from size AA to DDD and everything between, from puberty to motherhood, enhancement to cancer, and beyond. And she’s not alone - these are classic life stages for women today.&nbsp;</p> <p>At turns funny and heartbreaking, <i>A Boob’s Life</i> explores both the joys and hazards inherent to living in a woman’s body. Lehr deftly blends her personal narrative with national history, starting in the 1960s with the women’s liberation movement and moving to the current feminist dialogue and what it means to be a woman. Her insightful and clever writing analyzes how America’s obsession with the female form has affected her own life’s journey and the psyche of all women today.&nbsp;</p> <p>From her prize-winning fiction to her viral <i>New York Times</i> Modern Love essay, exploring the challenges facing contemporary women has been Lehr’s life-long passion. <i>A Boob’s Life</i>, her first project since breast cancer treatment, continues this mission, taking listeners on a wildly informative, deeply personal, and utterly relatable journey. No matter your gender, you’ll never view this sexy and sacred body part the same way again.</p>";
