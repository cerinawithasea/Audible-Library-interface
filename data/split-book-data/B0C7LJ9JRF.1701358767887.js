window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Melissa Foster comes a funny, sexy romantic comedy featuring a twice-divorced, stressed-out romance writer who finds out that sometimes true love can be a hot mess.</b></p> <p>Who buys a cottage in a New England fishing village on a whim? A stressed-out, twice-divorced romance writer and single mother looking for a fresh start, that’s who. Despite what my besties say about my three-year dry spell, I’m <i>not</i> looking for a man. Or drama. Or sex. I’ve got enough on my plate with writer’s block and a daughter who refuses to grow up. <i>Community.</i> That’s what I need. Unfortunately, it seems the universe has other ideas. Either Chatemup, Massachusetts, has a serious shortage of single women, or I’ve become a hot mess magnet for the male species.</p> <p>At least I’ve found one funny, good-hearted friend: fish peddler Declan Miller, my brainstorming adventure buddy who stirs my creative juices. I’m his Writer Girl. He’s my Dimple Dude. Just scruffy, granite-chested, deep-voiced, ex-military brawn who happens to be—<i>oh, Nicole, what are you doing to yourself?</i>—stoking a long-neglected fire without even trying.</p> <p>A self-confessed hot mess, divorced single dad Declan is too old for relationship games. Not interested. <i>Same here.</i> So why do I keep thinking about him? <i>Preferably naked.</i> Because I’m a hot mess, too? At least he’s inspiring me to write. If only real life were like one of my novels. At least then I’d have a better idea of how this was going to end.</p>";
