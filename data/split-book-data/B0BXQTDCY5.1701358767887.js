window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Considered “perhaps the most important American play of this century” by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, the Tony Award-winning Best Play has arrived on Audible. Based on <i>Howards End</i> by E.M. Forster, <i>The Inheritance</i> takes place in New York City decades after the AIDS epidemic. Eric Glass is a political activist engaged to his writer boyfriend, Toby Darling. When two strangers enter their lives—an older man and a younger one—their futures suddenly become uncertain as they begin to chart divergent paths. In this epic examination of survival, healing, and class divide, three generations of gay men attempt to forge a future for themselves amid a turbulent and changing America.</p> <p><b>The Tony Award-winning Best Play</b></p>";
