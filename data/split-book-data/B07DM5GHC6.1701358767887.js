window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After surviving the horrors of the Holocaust - in ghettos, on death marches, and in concentration camps - a young couple seeks refuge in Canada. They settle into a new life, certain that the terrors of their past are behind them. They build themselves a cozy little cottage on a lake in Muskoka, a cottage that becomes emblematic of their victory over the Nazis.</p> <p>The charming retreat is a safe haven, a refuge from haunted memories. That is, until a single act of unspeakable violence defiles their sanctuary. Poking around the dark crawl space beneath their cottage, they discover a wooden crate, nailed tightly shut and almost hidden from view. Nothing could have prepared them for the horror of the crate's contents - or how the peace and tranquility of their lives would be shattered.</p> <p>Now, their daughter, Debbie Levison, an award-winning journalist, tells the extraordinary account of her parents' ordeals, both in one of the darkest times in world history and their present-day lives. Written in searing, lyrical prose, <i>The Crate: A Story of War, a Murder, and Justice</i> examines man's seemingly limitless capacity for evil...but also, his capacity for good.</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
