window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the spellbinding and suspenseful <i>Let Me Die in His Footsteps</i>, Edgar Award winner Lori Roy wrests from a Southern town the secrets of two families touched by an evil that has passed between generations. </p> <p>On a dark Kentucky night in 1952, exactly halfway between her 15th and 16th birthdays, Annie Holleran crosses into forbidden territory. Everyone knows Hollerans don't go near Baines - not since Joseph Carl was buried two decades before - but armed with a silver-handled flashlight, Annie runs through her family's lavender fields toward the well on the Baines' place. At the stroke of midnight, she gazes into the water in search of her future. Not finding what she had hoped for, she turns from the well, and when the body she sees there in the moonlight is discovered come morning, Annie will have much to explain and a past to account for. </p> <p>It was 1936, and there were seven Baine boys. That year Annie's aunt, Juna Crowley, with her black eyes and her long blond hair, came of age. Before Juna, Joseph Carl had been the best of all the Baine brothers. But then he looked into Juna's eyes, and they made him do things that cost innocent people their lives. Sheriff Irlene Fulkerson saw justice served - or did she? </p> <p>As the lavender harvest approaches and she comes of age as Aunt Juna did in her own time, Annie's dread mounts. Juna will come home now to finish what she started. If Annie is to save herself, her family, and this small Kentucky town, she must prepare for Juna's return and the revelation of what really happened all those years ago. </p>";
