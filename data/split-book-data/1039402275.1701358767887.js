Eldon, shirt-tail relative and owner of one of the largest cattle ranches in Grand County, has been killed. Kate's husband, Ted, the Grand County sheriff, has been shot and may never walk again. And worst of all, Ted is the prime suspect in Eldon’s murder.</p> <p>Desperate to clear Ted's name, Kate throws herself headlong into the hunt for the real killer. When she finds herself the victim of several mysterious “accidents”, she knows she’s running out of time. If she doesn’t find out who killed Eldon soon, she - or someone else in town - may be the next to turn up dead.</p> <p>But a shocking confession throws everything into doubt, and as Kate keeps digging, she unearths unfathomable secrets - the kind worth killing for.</p>";
