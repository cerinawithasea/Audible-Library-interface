window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Amazon! Several years ago, Amazon made a conscious choice to invest in downtown Seattle, even though it would've been cheaper to move to the suburbs. Amazon chose to commit to Seattle because they believed it was the right choice for Amazon employees and for the city. Now, Amazon's Headquarters is made up of over 30 office buildings. On this Amazon Headquarters Tour, you will learn how Amazon's unique urban campus is deeply connected to the surrounding community. In addition, you will explore Amazon's history, learn about Amazon's customer obsession, and find out why at Amazon, every day truly is Day 1. In fact, the tour starts at our office building called Day 1 at 2121 7th Ave. Seattle, WA 98121. It ends in South Lake Union at 399 Fairview Ave. N. Seattle, WA 98109. </p>";
