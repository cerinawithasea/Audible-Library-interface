window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bob Lazar was a brilliant young physicist that found himself employed at a top-secret facility in the middle of the desert outside Las Vegas. Under the watchful eye of the government elite, he is tasked with understanding an exotic propulsion system being used by an advanced aerospace vehicle he is told came from outer space.&nbsp;</p> <p>The stressful work and long, odd hours start to wear on Bob and he becomes concerned for his safety. He tells his wife and a couple close friends about what he's doing in the desert, and his employers find out and are furious. When they station goons outside his house, Bob seeks help from wealthy UFOlogist, John Lear, who encourages Bob to take his story to award-winning investigative journalist George Knapp at KLAS-TV, a CBS affiliate.&nbsp;</p> <p>To prove he's telling the truth, Bob takes a group of people out into the desert to watch a test flight of the \"flying saucer.\" On the way home, they are stopped by the police, who notify the base, and Bob loses his job. In a series of interviews with CBS TV, Bob Lazar then blows the lid off \"Area 51\", blows the whistle on the effort to conceal this craft from the American people, and blows up his career as a top physicist.</p>";
