window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you’ve ever been so pissed off that you did things that you regretted, or ruined your own day and some other people’s, too, this book is for you.&nbsp;Or if you feel angry every&nbsp;single&nbsp;day&nbsp;and it’s affecting your health and sleep and love of life.&nbsp;Or if you have very good reasons to be mad as hell, and you aren’t going to take it anymore. Or if you’ve repressed your anger all your life and now it’s all coming out at once.&nbsp;Microcosm Publishing best seller Dr. Faith explains here what the hell is going on in your brain and how to retrain yourself to deal with enraging situations more productively and without torpedoing your relationships.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Unf*ck Your Anger</i>&nbsp;gives you a heady dose of neuroscience and cultural explanation of what anger is and what it does to you, and then gives you a handy four-step checklist to help you deal with maddening situations after (or before) the fact, guidance on getting over things, and a chapter on forgiveness. Your brain actually knows what it’s doing, and anger can be a good thing sometimes - just not if it’s ruining your life.</p>";
