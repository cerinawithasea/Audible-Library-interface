They are two inches tall.</p> <p>From Steven Millhauser, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Martin Dressler </i>and one of the most imaginative and essential voices of our time, comes a fable about a race of miniature people and the way of life they have come master within our own.&nbsp;By turns enchanting and provocative, <i>The Little People </i>explores the fascination and unease the little people create in us, examines our private desire to disappear into their world, and reveals what happens when our personal and romantic lives inevitably collide.&nbsp;</p>";
