window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the beginning of time, there have been many monumental questions that have perplexed the human race such as: Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? And... Who’s on first?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The History of Sketch Comedy</i>, Emmy and Peabody-winning actor, writer and producer Keegan-Michael Key (Key &amp; Peele, <i>The Prom</i>, <i>Jingle Jangle</i>) embarks listeners on an epic, insightful and utterly entertaining voyage through the annals of sketch comedy. Key takes us from the early flatulence jokes of Ancient Greece and the acting troupes of Europe in the 1500s, to the rise of The Second City in Chicago and his own comedy origins on the ball fields near Detroit’s 8 Mile. Equal parts masterclass, personal odyssey and virtuoso performance; Key's <i>The History of Sketch Comedy </i>dissects the landmark characters, concepts and performers that pushed the boundaries and forged new ground in the comedy pantheon, and along the way reveals his own experiences of discovering and being influenced by them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of ten half-hour chapters, one of the most beloved voices of our time treats listeners to a private, millennia-spanning interpretation of sketch comedy history, from its humble past to its immodest present.</p>";
