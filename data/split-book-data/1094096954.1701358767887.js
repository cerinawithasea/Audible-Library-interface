The Nixon Administration, itself involved in a cover-up, was the victim of a journalistic smoke-screen that prevented mitigation of its criminal guilt. As a result of the paper’s successful misdirection, today’s strikingly deceptive partisan journalism can be laid at the doorstep of the <i>Washington Post</i>.</p> <p>After Deep Throat’s lawyer, author John O’Connor, discovered that the <i>Post</i> had betrayed his client while covering up the truth about Watergate, his indefatigable research resulted in <i>Postgate</i>, a profoundly shocking tale of journalistic deceit.</p> <p>In an era when numerous modern media outlets rail about the guilt of their political enemies for speaking untruths, <i>Postgate</i> proves that the media can often credibly be viewed as the party actually guilty of deception. Americans today mistrust the major media more than ever. <i>Postgate</i> will prove that this distrust is richly deserved.</p>";
