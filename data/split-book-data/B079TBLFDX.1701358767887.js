window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We all have certain images of Ben Franklin: the witty Founding Father who promoted independence; the Philadelphia printer who created <i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i>; the scientist who conducted experiments with kites in electrical storms; the author of what is arguably America's best-known autobiography. These images reveal an intellectually curious and successful man of the 18th century, but they don't fully capture the full spirit of one of the most extraordinary Americans - perhaps the quintessential American.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why is Benjamin Franklin so compelling? What made him so successful in his day? And why has he continued to influence generations of Americans? Tackle these questions and more in <i>The Age of Benjamin Franklin</i>, a thorough - and sometimes surprising - course that presents a full portrait of a personality that defies easy definition. Taught by Professor Robert J. Allison of Suffolk University, these 24 insightful lectures explore the many facets of Franklin's life and times. From his humble beginnings as the son of a Boston soap maker to a world-renowned diplomat, you'll explore the many sides of this complex man, who somehow found time to:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Build a national printing business&nbsp;</li> <li>Open America's first library&nbsp;</li> <li>Pioneer the development of the post office&nbsp;</li> <li>Publish a number of satires&nbsp;</li> <li>Invent the Franklin stove&nbsp;</li> <li>Help create and codify the science of electricity&nbsp;</li> <li>Write a string quartet&nbsp;</li> <li>Write one of the first texts about chess published in the US&nbsp;</li> <li>Take up swimming&nbsp;</li> <li>Write his memoirs&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Amid all that, Franklin traveled the world, helped draft the Declaration of Independence, negotiated for support during the war and peace after, served in Congress, and helped establish American government. He was a busy, busy man: ambitious, worldly, imaginative, and forward thinking, representing the best output from the Age of Enlightenment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
