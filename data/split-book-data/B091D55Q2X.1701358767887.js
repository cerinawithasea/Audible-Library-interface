window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From a stunning new Latino voice, <i>Myth of the Self-Made Man</i> is a wildly inventive story - part sci-fi, with echoes of <i>Get Out</i> - that plunges us into a brave new American landscape.</p> <p>More than a hundred years into the future, as the US approaches its 400th anniversary, Tomas, a young graduate student, searches for the real identity of one of the cyborgs that maintained American homes. He has been haunted for years by an audio clip of a cyborg named Felipe and is intent on writing Felipe’s biography. In the clip, Felipe can only recite that he was made in America, but Tomas must find out: Where was the Self-made Man really from?</p> <p>In the National Archives, Tomas uncovers a trove of articles, depositions, and interviews about many other cyborgs, boys from El Salvador and Guatemala kidnapped, detained, and reengineered at a monolithic New England company.</p> <p>As we follow Tomas’ determined investigation into these lives, their voices echo through our own past, present, and future with unsettling clarity.&nbsp;</p>";
