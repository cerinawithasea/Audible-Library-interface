window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In \"People in Hell Want Ice Water\" - an eerie and suspenseful short story about connection, trust, and self-preservation - a random hookup amidst the COVID-19 pandemic brings two lonely people together when they need it most. Colin is an immunocompromised software engineer living alone in Los Angeles when he meets Martha on an early morning walk. She’s irreverent and mysterious, and although Colin knows better than to invite a stranger into his house, it’s been over 40 days since he’s been touched, and he can’t resist the temptation. This decision upends his quiet and regimented life: Martha cooks them elaborate meals and uncorks bottle after bottle of wine until they stumble to bed drunk every night. Within days she’s moved in. As their relationship evolves, doubts creep in. Colin and Martha realize just how little they know about one another, and the secrets they each keep begin to come to light.&nbsp;</p> <p>Acclaimed author Edan Lepucki packs all the drama and intrigue of her breakout novels <i>California </i>and <i>Woman No. 17</i> into this one-sitting listen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Please note this Original contains adult content and language.&nbsp;</p>";
