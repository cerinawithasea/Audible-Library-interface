window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Inspired by real Holocaust events, this poignant debut novel is a powerful coming-of-age story that will resonate with fans of </b><b><i>The Book Thief</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Between Shades of Gray</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Hanna Slivka is on the cusp of 14 when Hitler's army crosses the border into Soviet-occupied Ukraine. Soon, the Gestapo closes in, determined to make the <i>shtetele</i> she lives in \"free of Jews\". Until the German occupation, Hanna spent her time exploring Kwasova with her younger siblings, admiring the drawings of the handsome Leon Stadnick, and helping her neighbor dye decorative <i>pysanky </i>eggs. But now she, Leon, and their families are forced to flee and hide in the forest outside their <i>shtetele </i>- and then in the dark caves beneath the rolling meadows, rumored to harbor evil spirits.</p> <p>Underground, they battle sickness and starvation, while the hunt continues above. When Hanna's father disappears, suddenly it's up to Hanna to find him - and to find a way to keep the rest of her family, and friends, alive.</p> <p>Sparse, resonant, and lyrical, weaving in tales of Jewish and Ukrainian folklore, <i>My Real Name Is Hanna </i>celebrates the sustaining bonds of family, the beauty of a helping hand, and the tenacity of the human spirit.</p>";
