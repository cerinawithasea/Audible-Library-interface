window.bookSummaryJSON = "The Battle of Little Bighorn in Montana in 1876 has become known as <i>the</i> quintessential clash of cultures between the Lakota Sioux and whites. The men who led the battle, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and Colonel George A. Custer, have become the stuff of legends. <p> Here, award-winning Lakota historian Joseph M. Marshall III reveals the nuanced complexities that led up to and followed the battle. Until now, this account has been available only within the Lakota oral tradition. <i>The Day the World Ended at Little Bighorn</i> is required listening for anyone enthralled by the tale of the encounter that changed the scope of both America and the American landscape.</p>";
