But that number’s dropping all of the time....&nbsp;</p> <p>Lying northeast of Massachusetts, just south of Hell, Arkham County is somewhere you find yourself, not somewhere you ever mean to go. Once you do find it though, you'd better get used to living there, as you may be there for however long you have left to live.&nbsp;</p> <p>From within the walls of Arkham’s asylum, reclusive writer Randolph Carter tells the story of orphan Violet Flintock, who arrives in Arkham County in search of her own history only to be instantly greeted by the bloody realities of this small town, whose foundations are built from the lore and mythology of HP Lovecraft.</p> <p>In this Audible Original production, Stanley Tucci (<i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, <i>Fortitude</i>) leads a cast to introduce you to the horrific, bizarre and just plain weird world of Arkham County.
