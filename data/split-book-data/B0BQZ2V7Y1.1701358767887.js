window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Coral Castle</i> is the first audiobook to take an objective, journalistic look at one of America's most intriguing places: Coral Castle, located in Homestead, Florida.</p> <p>Edward Leedskalnin, an eccentric Latvian immigrant, built Coral Castle in the 1920s and 30s. Working alone with primitive tools, he quarried, carved, and set in place more than 1,100 tons of coral rock, creating what is commonly known as the American Stonehenge. How he accomplished this amazing feat remains a mystery.</p> <p>Some believe he was simply a talented stonemason and engineer. Many others believe he had somehow harnessed anti-gravity powers. Several books have been written on Ed's otherworldly powers, and he has become a cult figure to those who believe in extra-terrestrials and the magnetic grid theory. In <i>Coral Castle</i>, Rusty McClure and Jack Heffron survey the theories, and tell the story, through journalistic investigation and interviews with experts on all sides of the argument.</p>";
