window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On a warm night in September 1985, teenagers Kimberly Dowell and Ethan Dixon were brutally murdered in Westside Park in Muncie, Indiana. Their killer has never been charged. Early on, police focused on a family member of one of the teens as a primary suspect. The investigation even ruled out fantastic scenarios, including a theory that the perpetrator was a <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> devotee. The case grew cold.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only decades later did a dogged police investigator narrow the scope to a suspect whose name has never been publicly revealed until now. Keith Roysdon and Douglas Walker, authors of <i>Wicked Muncie</i> and <i>Muncie Murder &amp; Mayhem</i>, have followed the investigation into the Westside Park murders for decades and, for the first time, report the complete and untold story.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
