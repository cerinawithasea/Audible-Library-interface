window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A mother and her three young children are found hacked to death in their beds. The apparent weapons, an ax and butcher knife, are found nearby. A month later, the husband and father, who was away on a business trip when the bodies were found, is accused of the killings. Police believe he methodically murdered his wife and children before he left. But why?&nbsp;</p> <p>A successful businessman and devoted member of a fundamentalist religious group, David Hendricks has the total support of his extended family. Police paint a darker picture, and prosecutors face the daunting task of convicting him on a case based on completely circumstantial evidence.</p> <p>A <i>New York Times</i> best seller, this book has now been updated with additional content. People often comment they must continually remind themselves that this story is real, that <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> is testament to the fact truth is stranger than fiction. The book has also been used in college-level criminal justice courses to explain and illustrate the legal concept of reasonable doubt.</p>";
