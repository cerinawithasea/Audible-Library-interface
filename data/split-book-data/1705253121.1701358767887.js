window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There have been many books written about Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, but only by people who weren't there. Walter Lure was - from the band's chaotic beginnings on New York's Lower East Side, through a now-legendary UK tour with the Sex Pistols and the Clash, and on to a yearlong stay in London - eyewitness and midwife to the birth of UK punk.</p> <p>Now, he tells his story in <i>To Hell and Back</i>, a thrilling ride through the clubs and dives of two continents, in the company of one of the most notorious junkies in rock 'n' roll history. Drawing from his own contemporary journals, Lure paints a vivid portrait of life in both cities, during perhaps the most crucial musical uprising of the past 40 years...the music, the characters, the clothes, the fights, the drugs, the orgies, the lot.</p> <p>Lure lays bare his own battle with drugs and reflects upon his life after the band's split - rising to become a Wall Street fixture yet still finding time to make music.</p>";
