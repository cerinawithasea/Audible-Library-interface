window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine if you made one little mistake when you were young and were punished for it for the rest of your life. Well, that’s what happened to Lydia (yes, that Lydia, the youngest Bennet sister from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>), and she’s here to set the record straight. Hold on to your teacups and get ready for sophisticated (and a little bit naughty) hot takes and witty banter that’ll make you laugh—and think.</p> <p>We meet Lydia just as she is denounced by her family, exiled miles from home, and married to the rogue George Wickham, who seems to love all women...except his own wife. She must learn to summon great bravery to carve out a place for herself in the society that has brutally rejected her.</p> <p>Lydia isn’t the traditional Austen heroine, and this isn’t a traditional, polite period drama. Lydia is a badass. A trailblazer. She’s fierce and fiercely funny. And she might inhabit the Regency period, but she’s fighting the same battle many of us are today—having to defend the decisions she’s made and the person she chooses to love, to shut out the 'trolls' and gossips, to hold her head high in a world that will judge her for any mistake she makes.</p> <p>Starring Academy Award nominee Jessie Buckley (<i>Fargo</i>, <i>The Lost Daughter</i>) and Johnny Flynn (<i>Lovesick</i>, <i>Stardust</i>), this hilarious and timely listen is for fans of classics with a twist. Writer and creator playwright Sarah Page says that she wrote Mrs. Wickham to 'entertain people with a romantic, optimistic, and seductive comedy,' but that there’s also a 'message held at its heart to treat each other with kindness.'&nbsp;</p> <p>If you binged <i>Bridgerton</i>, this one’s for you.</p> <p>Starring: Jessie Buckley, Johnny Flynn, Emily Barber,&nbsp;Fehinti Balogun, Adrian Edmondson, Leila Farzad, Stephanie Hyam, Jodie McNee, Natalie Simpson,&nbsp;Ray Panthaki and Emily Johnstone</p> <p>Directed by Eleanor Rhode. Sound Design by David Gregory.&nbsp;Co-produced by Wondermore Productions.</p> <p><b>Portions of this audio drama contain mature language and themes. Listener discretion is advised.</b></p>";
