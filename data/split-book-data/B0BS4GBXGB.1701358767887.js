window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>This Is Where We Talk Things Out</i> by Caitlin Marceau, author of <i>Palimpsest: A Collection of Contemporary Horror</i>, follows the gut-wrenching journey of Miller and her estranged mother Sylvie, who have always had a tense relationship.</p> <p>After Miller's father dies, she agrees to a girls' vacation away from the city to reconnect with the only family she has left. Although she’s eager to make things work, Miller can’t help but worry that her mother is seeing their countryside retreat as a fun weekend getaway instead of what it really is: a last-ditch effort to repair their relationship.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that quickly becomes the least of Miller’s problems.</p> <p>Sylvie's trapped in the past, and if Miller's not careful, she will be too. A cross between Stephen King's <i>Misery</i> and Stephanie Wrobel's <i>Darling Rose Gold</i>, <i>This Is Where We Talk Things Out</i> explores the horror of familial trauma, mother-daughter relationships, and what happens when we don't let go.</p>";
