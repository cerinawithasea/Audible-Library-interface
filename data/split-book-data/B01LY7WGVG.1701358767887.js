window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An abusive mother</b> </p> <p>Raised in the suburb of Riverside, California, 20-year-old college student Jason Bautista endured for years his emotionally disturbed mother's verbal and psychological abuse. She even locked him out of the house, tied him up with electrical cord, and on one occasion, gave him a beating that sent him to the emergency room. </p> <p><b>A son's revenge</b> </p> <p>On the night of January 14, 2003, Jason strangled his mother. To keep authorities from identifying her body, he chopped off her head and hands, an idea he claimed he got from watching an episode of the hit TV series <i>The Sopranos</i>. Jason's 15-year-old half-brother, Matthew, would later testify in court that he sat in another room in the house with the TV volume turned up while Jason murdered their mother. </p> <p><b>A crime that would bond two brothers</b> </p> <p>The morning following the murder, Matthew went to school, and Jason returned to his classes at Cal State San Bernardino. When authorities zeroed in on them, Jason lied and said that his mother had run off with a boyfriend she'd met on the Internet. But when police confronted the boys with overwhelming evidence, Jason confessed all. Now the nightmare was only just beginning for him. </p>";
