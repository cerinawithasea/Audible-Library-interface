window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For fans of <i>The War That Saved My Life</i> and other World War II fiction, <i>A Place to Hang the Moon</i> is the tale of three orphaned siblings who are evacuated from London to live in the countryside with the secret hope of finding a permanent family.</p> <p>It is 1940 and William, 12, Edmund, 11, and Anna, nine, aren't terribly upset by the death of the not-so-grandmotherly grandmother who has taken care of them since their parents died. But the children do need a guardian, and in the dark days of World War II London, those are in short supply, especially if they hope to stay together. Could the mass wartime evacuation of children from London to the countryside be the answer?</p> <p>It's a preposterous plan, but off they go - keeping their predicament a secret, and hoping to be placed in a temporary home that ends up lasting forever. Moving from one billet to another, the children suffer the cruel trickery of foster brothers, the cold realities of outdoor toilets, and the hollowness of empty stomachs. They find comfort in the village lending library, whose kind librarian, Nora Müller, seems an excellent choice of billet, except that her German husband's whereabouts are currently unknown, and some of the villagers consider her unsuitable.</p>";
