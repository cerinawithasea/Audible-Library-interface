window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Exploring otherness, identity, faith, religion, gender and sexual trauma, <i>Hag</i> brings together a gripping collection of tales that are unsettlingly timely and wickedly sinister. Each story is inspired by a forgotten folk tale sourced from across the UK by Professor Carolyne Larrington, a specialist in Old Norse and British fairy tales at St John's College, Oxford. Drawn from illuminated manuscripts and other folkloric traditions, these stories have been revised and reimagined by authors local to each region. Just as the Brothers Grimm codified Germany's rural folk lore, <i>Hag</i> catalogues the early myths and legends that have shaped the UK's storytelling heritage. </p><p>Each story has been richly sound-designed, combining subtle vocal effects, atmospheric textures and an original score. </p><p>Listeners who want to find out more about the forgotten folk tales that inspired Hag will be able to explore further with a series of accompanying interviews between Professor Carolyne Larrington and the authors. </p><p>This is an Audible Original Podcast.
