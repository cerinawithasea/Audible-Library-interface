window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two hundred and rising. That's the death tally for the Obama administration's \"Operation Fast &amp; Furious.\" The program was supposedly designed to \"win the drug war\" by deliberately walking more than two thousand guns across the border to Mexico. But instead of catching drug lords, Fast &amp; Furious armed the very kingpins it was supposed to trap. </p> <p>Despite the protests of gun store owners and ATF whistle-blowers, federal agents deliberately violated federal law-and common sense-and wound up placing American weapons into the hands of Mexico's most violent criminals. And when the guns started showing up at crime scenes-including the murder scene of a U.S. border patrol agent-the cover-up began. So reveals Townhall editor Katie Pavlich in her news-breaking expos√© <i>Fast and Furious: Barack Obama's Bloodiest Scandal</i>. </p> <p>While the White House has claimed ignorance of the program, Pavlich debunks their lies, denials and excuses by demonstrating incontestable proof that President Obama and Attorney General Holder did willfully and knowingly sanction the program in order to advance their anti-second amendment agenda. </p> <p>A horrifying look at one of the bloodiest scandals in the history of the American presidency, <i>Fast and Furious</i> is this season's sensational, must-listen book that will rock America-and the Obama administration-to its core. </p>";
