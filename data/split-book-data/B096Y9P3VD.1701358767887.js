window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ours is an urban age. Before 1800, less than one in 10 people lived in cities. Today, more than eight in 10 people in the Western Hemisphere alone live in cities. From Uruk and Eridu in ancient Mesopotamia to London and New York City in the 21st century, cities have long supported and sustained what makes us human.&nbsp;</p> <p>But can they survive the next 100 years? If so, they’re going to have to remain livable. In this 10-lecture series, focusing on that livability is at the heart of livable cities, Professor Mark Alan Hughes discusses why we seek out cities and how they create the conditions that allow us to meet our fundamental needs as individuals and as a human community.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll examine the many innovative ways cities around the world meet our most important needs - refuge, exchange, meaning, freedom, identity, knowledge, health, and nature - through everything from neighborhood design to recreational trails to creative programs promoting political engagement. You’ll also reflect on some of the most controversial issues cities face today, including racial inequality, pandemics, and climate change. And you’ll come away with lessons in livability that offer a toolbox for unlocking their benefits anywhere.</p> <p>There are millions of stories in every major city. Start here with<i> Livable Cities </i>to learn a few of them.</p>";
