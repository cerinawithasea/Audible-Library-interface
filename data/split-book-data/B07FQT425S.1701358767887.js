window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters</i></b><b> comes an in-depth examination of sexual serial killers throughout human history, how they evolved, and why we are drawn to their horrifying crimes.</b></p> <p>Before the term was coined in 1981, there were no \"serial killers.\" There were only \"monsters\" - killers society first understood as werewolves, vampires, ghouls and witches or, later, Hitchcockian psychos.</p> <p>In <i>Sons of Cain - </i>a book that fills the gap between dry academic studies and sensationalized true crime - investigative historian Peter Vronsky examines our understanding of serial killing from its prehistoric anthropological evolutionary dimensions in the pre-civilization era (c. 15,000 BC) to today. Delving further back into human history and deeper into the human psyche than <i>Serial Killers - </i>Vronsky's 2004 book, which has been called \"the definitive history of the phenomenon of serial murder\" - he focuses strictly on sexual serial killers: thrill killers who engage in murder, rape, torture, cannibalism and necrophilia, as opposed to for-profit serial killers, including hit men, or \"political\" serial killers, like terrorists or genocidal murderers.</p> <p>These sexual serial killers differ from all other serial killers in their motives and their foundations. They are uniquely human and - as popular culture has demonstrated - uniquely fascinating.</p>";
