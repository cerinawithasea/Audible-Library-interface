Mamie wanted the horrific photograph of her son’s lynched body to be displayed for the world to see, to expose America to its own barbaric acts of racial terror. As such, Emmett’s death and Mamie’s actions afterwards would ignite a crucial moment in the civil rights movement, changing the course of history forever.</p> <p>Orion Pictures’ film <i>Till</i> tells the story of this mother’s loss and her determination to uphold her son’s legacy. <i>Till Today</i> is the standalone, five-part Audible Original companion podcast that explores what would come of Mamie’s work.
