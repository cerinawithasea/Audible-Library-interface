Baker also considers the wider role the royals play in society, including the link with House of Lords reform, and the constitutional position of the monarch, which is important given Prince Charles’ present and intended approach.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>...And What Do You Do?</i> asks important questions about the future of the world’s most famous royal family.</p>";
