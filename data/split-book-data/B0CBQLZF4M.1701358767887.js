window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the birth of hip-hop in the 1970s to today, women have been just as integral to the growth and development of the rap game as their male counterparts. Nonetheless, they’re consistently shortchanged as artists, creators, renegades, and cultural visionaries in prevailing histories of the genre.</p> <p><i>The Motherlode</i> changes that.</p> <p>Based on prolific music journalist Clover Hope’s book of the same name, <i>The Motherlode</i> digs deep into the history and misogyny of hip-hop to give props to its most continually overlooked innovators and underappreciated voices. From foundational figures like MC Sha-Rock and Roxanne Shanté to revolutionaries like Salt-N-Pepa and Lil’ Kim to modern chart-toppers like Cardi B and Nicki Minaj, Hope’s in-depth look at the many untold stories of women in hip-hop spans 50 years of excellence.</p> <p>An essential listen for true hip-hop heads and music history fans alike, <i>The Motherlode</i> is narrated by Hope herself along with special guests including Remy Ma, MC Lyte, and Nia Long. Get ready to add some new favorites to your playlist.</p> <p><i>Cover Illustrated by Rachelle Baker</i></p>";
