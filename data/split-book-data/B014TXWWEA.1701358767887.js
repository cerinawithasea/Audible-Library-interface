His debut novel, <i>The Mermaid</i>, has been published to rave reviews. So why is he as distant and unhappy as ever? </p> <p>When crime writer Erica Falck, who helped Christian discover and develop his talents, learns he has been receiving anonymous threats, she investigates not just the messages but also the young author's mysterious past. Then one of Christian's closet friends, Magnus, goes missing. </p> <p>Erica's husband, Detective Patrik Hedstrom, has his worst suspicions confirmed as the mind games aimed at Christian become a disturbing reality.
