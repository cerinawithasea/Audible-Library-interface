window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When raised to the level of art, seduction, an indirect and subtle form of power, has toppled empires, won elections, and enslaved great minds. <i>The Art of Seduction</i> synthesizes the legacies of civilization's greatest seducers - from Cleopatra to JFK - with the philosophies of important intellectuals on the subject, including everyone from Freud to Kierkegaard and Ovid to Casanova, and the classic literature of seduction. Robert Greene identifies the rules of a timeless, amoral game and explores how to cast a spell, break down resistance, and, ultimately, compel a target to surrender. <i>The Art of Seduction</i> is an indispensable primer on the essence of one of history's greatest weapons and the ultimate form of power.</p>";
