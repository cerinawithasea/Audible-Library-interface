window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the near future, lab-grown sex dolls are the pleasure toy of choice in this disturbing and provocative short story from Lauren Beukes, the bestselling author of <i>The Shining Girls</i>.</p> <p>Actor and sex worker Nats is experienced at putting on a show. However, her new gig supplying intimate whispers for <i>growgirls</i> takes her to a place darker and lonelier than she could have ever imagined. The lab-grown dolls can respond to pleasure or pain; their synthetic heads contain only the simplest AI to prevent any pesky robo sex doll uprisings. But just because <i>growgirls</i> don’t have a brain, doesn’t mean they don’t have a voice...</p> <p>Ungirls<i> is part of </i>Disorder<i>, a collection of six short stories of living nightmares, chilling visions, and uncanny imagination that explore a world losing its balance in terrifying ways. Each piece can be read or listened to in a single disorienting sitting.</i></p>";
