window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Learn how movies reveal the future of technology.</b></p> <p>Fans of <i>The Science of Interstellar</i>, <i>The Second Machine Age</i>, and <i>Physics of the Future</i> will love <i>Films from the Future</i>.</p> <p>Science, technology, and society: In <i>Films from the Future</i>, former physicist Andrew Maynard threads together his love of science-fiction movies with his expertise on emerging technologies to engage, entertain, and make you think about the relationship between technology and society. Through the imagination and creativity of science-fiction movies, Maynard introduces listeners to the profound capabilities presented by new and emerging technologies, and the complex personal and societal challenges they present.</p> <p>The future of artificial intelligence and other technologies: Each movie in the book provides the starting point for exploring key technologies and trends, from genetic engineering (<i>Jurassic Park</i>) and brain-enhancing drugs (<i>Limitless</i>) to human augmentation (<i>Ghost in the Shell</i>) and artificial intelligence (<i>Ex Machina</i>). These are woven together with emerging ideas on technological convergence and responsible and ethical innovation, to provide a sweeping perspective on where our technologies are taking us and how we ensure this is where we want to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>The enlightening science and philosophies of movies: With each examination of 12 movies, you will take a progressive journey through the fascinating worlds of biological and genetic manipulation, human enhancement and cyber technologies, and nanotechnology. Maynard reveals that the fantastical worlds of the movies might not be as impossible as we think. With a focus on hard science, economics, the social implications of technological feats, and the movies that could very well become our real-life future, <i>Films from the Future</i> will be sure to educate and entertain.</p>";
