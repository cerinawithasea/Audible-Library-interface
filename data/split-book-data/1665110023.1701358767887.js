window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Anxiety is a survival skill gone haywire. It happens when our brain is working so hard to protect us that it forgets to notice that the danger has passed. It feels like choking, stifling, smothering, tingling, panicking - our brains cut out and we start to make bad decisions - all normal anxiety reactions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Faith G. Harper, author of the best-selling <i>Unf--k Your Brain</i> and <i>This is Your Brain on Depression</i> packs a ton of knowledge and help into this practical manual. She helps us understand the history and science of anxiety, realize when it’s become a serious problem, know the difference between anxiety and other conditions, and cope with it in the moment as well as addressing it long term.&nbsp;</p> <p>This audiobook is a lifesaver for panic attacks, breaking out of flight-fight-freeze responses, similar and co-occurring conditions, and for chronic anxiety. Straightforward, funny, kind, and judgment-free, it includes a wide range of tips, exercises, and medical interventions. It’s also good for people who aren’t burdened by daily anxiety but want to cope better with the tough life situations we all face. Listen to this audiobook and breathe!</p>";
