window.bookSummaryJSON = "Leslie Morgan Steiner met the love of her life at age 22, soon after graduating from Harvard and starting her first job at <i>Seventeen</i> magazine in New York. She fell for his self-deprecating wit and street smarts - and especially his unabashed worship of her. They married and spent four years together. At first Leslie felt like the woman of his dreams. <p>Then she discovered her husband had been beaten as a child, taught by his parents that intimacy and rage danced together. He brought violence into their life, pouring coffee grinds over her hair, choking and threatening her with a gun during arguments. Several times, he came close to making good on his threats to kill her. Leslie's mistake is one millions identify with: she fell in love with the wrong man. It took one last terrifying attack to convince her that he would kill her one day if she let him. </p> <p>Gripping and compelling, <i>Crazy Love</i> unravels the traps laid by love, mesmerizing listeners with insights into why smart women stay in unhealthy relationships - and how one found the courage to leave.</p>";
