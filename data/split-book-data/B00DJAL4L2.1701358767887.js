window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At age three he was using knives to frighten his teenage aunt. By 14 he was a thief, animal abuser, and peeping tom who liked to pull little girls into the woods to scare them. </p> <p>Ted Bundy killed at least 35 girls and women, and possibly hundreds. Was his first victim eight-year-old Ann Marie Burr who disappeared from their Tacoma, Washington neighborhood in 1961? Her body was never found and there were no clues, just two tenacious detectives who spent the rest of their lives trying to solve the case. Was Bundy telling the truth when he told a hypothetical story about killing Ann and dumping her into a muddy pit? </p> <p>With new information about Ted Bundy's childhood, interviews with those who knew him best, and the memories of the Burr family, <i>Ted and Ann</i> is the story of one the 20th century's most fascinating cold cases. </p> <p>Rebecca Morris is an award-winning journalist who has worked in radio and television news in New York City; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington.
