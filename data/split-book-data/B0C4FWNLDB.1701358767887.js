window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A summer road trip turns into a journey of a life time, full of last chances and fresh starts, in this heartwarming short story from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Carolyn Brown.</b></p> <p>Nita, Sharlene, and Billy Joe, all about to turn 80, are tired of waiting their turn for a funeral dinner. They each have a bucket list and are determined to tick off at least a few of the items before they go. So what’s left but to hit the road? They enlist two drivers—Billy Joe’s great-grandson, Ford, who has just gotten out of the Air Force, and Sharlene’s great niece, Joelle, a schoolteacher who has the summer free.</p> <p>Spending the summer with three bickering old people in a tricked-out VW bus isn’t what Joelle or Ford had planned, but they aren’t about to let the trio go that far without help.&nbsp;Both at a crossroads in their lives, neither expect to discover an attraction simmering between them. But somewhere between horseback riding at a dude ranch and slow dancing at the Grand Ole Opry, they discover that their elderly companions aren’t the only ones who need to take some risks in life...and in love.</p>";
