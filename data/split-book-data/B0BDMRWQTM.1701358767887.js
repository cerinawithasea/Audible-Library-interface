window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s easy to dismiss dreams as “just dreams”—incoherent visions, disturbing, odd images that don’t really <i>mean</i> anything much. But in stories, myths, and fables, dreams are vital. They’re often used as a literary device to provide insights and foreshadowing. Through the dreams in stories, we get to the heart of deep philosophical, scientific, and religious problems. Dreams allowed writers to transcend boundaries and confront things otherwise off-limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In this eye-opening six-part series, Dr. Franziska Kohlt looks at the concept of dreams through the lens of the stories that feature them. You’ll visit the enchanted slumbering land of <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> and the dark and mysterious realm of <i>The Sandman</i>. You’ll explore the ironic dreaming devices of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>; the trippy, fantastical world of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>; and many more on the quest to deconstruct the symbolism and intent of the dreams that are part of the narrative—or even, in some cases, that are characters in the narrative.&nbsp;</p> <p>Join Dr. Kohlt in exploring your favorite books, stories, comics, and myths, and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of them by shining on a light on the parts of the tale that happen in the dark.</p>";
