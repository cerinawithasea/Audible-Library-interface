Badly injured and desperate to forget a nightmarish expedition that left him doubting his sanity, Watson is close to destitution when he meets the extraordinary Sherlock Holmes, who is investigating a series of deaths in the Shadwell district of London.

Forces that can be summoned, if one is brave - or mad - enough to dare â€¦</p>";
