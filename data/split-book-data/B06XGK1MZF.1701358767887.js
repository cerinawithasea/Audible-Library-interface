window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"My father had more than 50 children.\" </p> <p>So begins the haunting memoir of Anna LeBaron, daughter of the notorious polygamist and murderer Ervil LeBaron. With her father wanted by the FBI for killing anyone who tried to leave his cult - a radical branch of Mormonism - Anna and her siblings were constantly on the run with the other sister-wives. Often starving and always desperate, the children lived in terror. Even though there were dozens of them together, Anna always felt alone. </p> <p>She escaped when she was 13 - but the nightmare was far from over. </p> <p>A shocking true story of murder, fear, and betrayal, <i>The Polygamist's Daughter</i> is also the heart-cry of a fatherless girl and her search for love, faith, and a safe place to call home. </p>";
