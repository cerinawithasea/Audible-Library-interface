window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An incisive cultural history that captures a fractious nation through the prism of television and the rattled mind of a celebrity president </b></p> <p>In the tradition of Neil Postman's masterpiece <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i>, <i>Audience of One</i> shows how American media have shaped American society and politics, by interweaving two crucial stories. The first story follows the evolution of television from the three-network era of the 20th century, which joined millions of Americans in a shared monoculture, into today's zillion-channel, internet-atomized universe, which sliced and diced them into fractious, alienated subcultures. The second story is a cultural critique of Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p> <p>Reaching back to the 1940s, when Trump and commercial television were born, Poniewozik illustrates how Donald became \"a character that wrote itself, a brand mascot that jumped off the cereal box and entered the world, a simulacrum that replaced the thing it represented.\" Viscerally attuned to the media, Trump shape-shifted into a boastful tabloid playboy in the 1980s; a self-parodic sitcom fixture in the 1990s; a reality-TV \"You're Fired\" machine in the 2000s; and finally, the biggest role of his career, a Fox News-obsessed, Twitter-mad, culture-warring demagogue in the White House.</p>";
