window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Gwyneth Paltrow’s modern lifestyle brand goop comes the Audible Original <i>The goop Pursuit</i>, a four-part audio series taking listeners on an intimate journey of learning and unlearning.</p> <p>“Leaning into Pleasure”</p> <p>After her conversation with goop founder and CEO Gwyneth Paltrow, Penda N’diaye speaks with three women of different ages about being “detectives of their own pleasure”. N’diaye, who is the founder of Pro Hoe, a brand that focuses on sexual liberation in Black and Brown communities, explores the different ways we can experience pleasure. And she searches for answers to these questions: Why can satisfying sex be difficult to come by? How do we open up to exploring and expressing our desires? What can we look forward to along the way?</p> <p><b>This episode contains mature themes and listener discretion is advised.</b></p>";
