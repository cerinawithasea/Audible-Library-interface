window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you watch those stunning TV period dramas, do you ever wonder about the bits they don't show - where did the hero go for a \"comfort break\"? How did the beautiful heroine clean her pearly-white teeth? How often did they take a bath, and what did they use for soap? This book tries to answer these questions and many more. While not written primarily for laughs, it takes a light-hearted look at aspects of human hygiene down the ages, and in a range of cultures across the world, including the author's personal experiences in countries as diverse as Japan and Iceland. The perfect book to listen to in the little boys' (or girls') room! Narrated here by the author. </p>";
