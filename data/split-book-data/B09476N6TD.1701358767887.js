window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meet Frank Hardy, Faith Healer.</p> <p>This is one story with three storytellers, each with their own perspective on their shared history.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each tale brings new revelations through a spellbinding narrative that enters the realm of a deep, shamanic ritual, guiding the listener through the hearts and minds of faith healer Frank, his wife Grace and his manager Teddy.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Faith Healer </i>is recognised as a masterpiece of modern theatre. Written by Brian Friel, one of Irelandâ€™s most celebrated playwrights, <i>Faith Healer</i> is a dramatic enactment about the fictions of memory, a meditation on the role and responsibility of the artist in society and an exploration of the meanings of healing and salvation.</p> <p>This all-star production is created especially for Audible by internationally acclaimed theatre director Ian Rickson, former artistic director of the Royal Court, starring a cast of theatrical titans: Ciaran Hinds (<i>The Terror</i>, <i>The Crucible</i>), Michelle Fairley (<i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>Julius Caesar</i>) and Toby Jones (<i>Detectorists</i>, <i>Uncle Vanya</i>).
