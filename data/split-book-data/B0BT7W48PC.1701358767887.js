Journalist Patrick Abboud hears whispers that it was once home to the world’s only 'gay prison'. A prison that specifically incarcerated gay men. His investigation into what happened inside reveals the full story for the first time. This queer true-crime journey takes you from underground nightclubs to hidden sex haunts, to remote parts of New Zealand and England. You’ll find yourself entangled in a police cover up, a case of wrongful conviction and a human experiment that didn’t go to plan. At the centre of it all was a covert government operation to eradicate 'the greatest menace to society': homosexuality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now with a bonus episode, The Runaway: In the first year since the series' release the producers were flooded with new information. This episode features an extraordinary interview with a prison inmate and looks at how he wants to regain his dignity.</p> <p>Researched, written and produced by Patrick Abboud and Simon Cunich.&nbsp;</p> <p>Presented by Patrick Abboud.
