window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this darkly comic memoir, a young woman recounts the steps she took to rebuild her sense of self in the aftermath of two devastating strokes that robbed her of her ability to communicate.</p> <p>Nina Mitchell was an accomplished Harvard graduate whose world changed forever when her facility with language - and much of her personality - disappeared. Lacking the tools to navigate her old life, Nina was forced to create another one. In <i>After Words</i>, she shares her remarkable journey as she slowly reclaims the power to converse, write, assert her identity, and to be herself - with words.</p> <p><i>Nina Mitchell’s </i>After Words<i> is part of </i>Missing<i>, a collection of six true stories about finding, restoring, or accepting the losses that define our lives - from the mysterious to the inspiring. Each story can be listened to in a single sitting.</i></p>";
