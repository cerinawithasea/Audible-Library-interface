window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Abuse of Power</i> is a podcast that identifies and discusses the various ways in which law enforcement and the justice system have victimized the very people they are supposed to protect: us.</p> <p>Coerced confessions. Fabricated evidence. Arresting and prosecuting the innocent. While attention has rightfully been focused recently on police brutality in the street, the abuse of power in that context is only the tip of the iceberg. The problems are systemic. They spread beyond abuse in the street and pervade the entire criminal justice system. Award-winning journalist and criminal defence attorney, Sonya Pfeiffer, and her husband and law partner, David Rudolf, scrutinise this abuse by spotlighting 10 cases across 10 episodes in which law enforcement misconduct within the justice system resulted in the imprisonment of innocent people.</p> <p>Featuring exclusive interviews with those directly involved in each case – including defendants, lawyers, experts and family members – Sonya and David dive deep into each case, providing listeners with an overview of the abuse that occurred, while also highlighting the fallout and showcasing the untold stories of those impacted by the abuses of law enforcement within the criminal justice system.</p>";
