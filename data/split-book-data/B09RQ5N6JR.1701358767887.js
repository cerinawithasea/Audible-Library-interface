But they maintain their innocence and are fighting to clear their names.&nbsp;</p> <p>Presented by Raphael Rowe, a journalist who himself spent 12 years locked up for a crime he didn’t commit, this series delves into both sides of the case, exploring each twist and turn, to piece together the real Freshwater Five story.&nbsp;</p> <p>A Message Heard production for Audible Original Podcasts.</p>";
