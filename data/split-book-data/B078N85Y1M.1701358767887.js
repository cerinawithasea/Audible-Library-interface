window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exquisitely nuanced and profoundly intimate, </b><b><i>The Night Child</i></b><b> is a story of resilience, hope, and the capacity of the mind, body, and spirit to save itself despite all odds.</b></p> <p>Nora Brown teaches high school English and lives a quiet life in Seattle with her husband and six-year-old daughter. But one November day, moments after dismissing her class, a girl’s face appears above the students’ desks—“a wild numinous face with startling blue eyes, a face floating on top of shapeless drapes of purples and blues where arms and legs should have been. Terror rushes through Nora’s body—the kind of raw terror you feel when there’s no way out, when every cell in your body, your entire body, is on fire—when you think you might die.”</p> <p>Twenty-four hours later, while on Thanksgiving vacation, the face appears again. Shaken and unsteady, Nora meets with neurologists and eventually, a psychiatrist. As the story progresses, a terrible secret is discovered—a secret that pushes Nora toward an even deeper psychological breakdown.</p> <p>This breathtaking debut novel examines the impact of traumatic childhood experiences and the fragile line between past and present.</p>";
