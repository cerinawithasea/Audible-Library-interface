window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Medieval history from a rising star in the field, this is a biography of one of the most important figures of the age, John of Gaunt.</b></p> <p>John Gaunt was the son of Edward III, brother to the Black Prince, father to Henry IV, and the sire of all those Tudors. He has had pretty bad press: supposed usurper of Richard II’s crown and the focus of hatred in the Peasants’ Revolt, as they torched his home, the Savoy Palace.</p> <p>Helen Carr paints a complex portrait of a man who held the levers of power on the English and European stage, passionately upheld chivalric values, pressed for the Bible to be translated into English, patronized the arts - and, if you follow Shakespeare, gave the most beautiful oration on England: “this sceptred isle...this blessed plot.”</p> <p><i>The Red Prince </i>is an engrossing drama of political machinations, violence, romance, plague, revolt, and tragedy played out at the cusp of a new era.</p>";
