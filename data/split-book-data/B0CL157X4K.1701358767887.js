window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the producers of <i>Smile</i> and <i>The Outsider</i> comes a chilling psychological thriller starring Isabela Merced (<i>Alien, Superman Legacy</i>) and Christopher Briney (<i>The Summer I Turned Pretty</i>).</p> <p>Aaron Fortin is new in town. He drives a brand-new Acura—a gift from his parents for uprooting him in the middle of senior year. Showing up on his first day at the local public school in that nice of a car? He knows he’ll never blend in, and he doesn’t care to try. The car, the new kid mystique, he can use all that....</p> <p>Crystal Giordano carpools to the same school in her friend Trevor’s beat-up van. In the van along with Crystal and Trevor are Paul, Harmony, and Gayle. Crystal’s technically part of their misfit group, but most of the time, she feels like she’s the only one who <i>doesn’t</i> fit.</p> <p>When Aaron Fortin sits at their lunch table, Crystal can see he’s not who he says he is. But how big of a fraud is Aaron Fortin? Crystal clumsily exposes Aaron and becomes his target, falling victim to his insidious campaign to erase her. Only then does she discover who he truly is—and it’s so much worse than she thought.</p> <p>As her friends begin to follow him one by one, Crystal wonders if she can protect them or if his influence is just too strong.</p> <p><i>Please note: This Audible Original contains graphic violence and themes of drug addiction and sexual assault.
