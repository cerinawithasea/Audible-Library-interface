With a net worth of almost $18 billion, he is not only one of the richest and most influential people on the planet, but his vast media empire has influenced governments and changed the course of history.</p> <p>Murdoch has been married four times and has fathered six children. He has exhibited a penchant for pitting his three middle children, Lachlan, James, and Elizabeth, against each other in lengthy competitions to become his favorite, and, therefore, heir to his businesses.</p> <p>In 2017, Murdoch announced to his children the unthinkable: that he’d be selling the biggest part of his media dynasty, 20th Century Fox. But only one of them could take the reins. Immediately, his children go to war, vying against each other for both their father's approval and his empire. The public and private feuds play out like Shakespearean tragedies, as the Murdoch family turns on one another in private and public displays of nepotism, sibling rivalry, entitlement, and international scandals.</p> <p>Narrated by <i>Succession</i>’s Alan Ruck, <i>Bitter Blood Season 2: Murdoch v. Murdoch</i> is a look at the inner workings of this famous family, told through exclusive interviews with key insiders, including employees, Murdoch biographers, and journalists. This is the tale of a family that battles for wealth and power at all costs, even if that means battling against each other until the bitter end.</p>";
