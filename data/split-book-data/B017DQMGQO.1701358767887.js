window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The professional and personal lives of the pioneers of an enduring magazine, <i>The New Yorker</i>. </p> <p>From its birth in 1925 to the early days of the Cold War, <i>The New Yorker</i> slowly but surely took hold as the country's most prestigious, entertaining, and informative general-interest periodical. In <i>Cast of Characters</i>, Thomas Vinciguerra paints a portrait of the magazine's cadre of charming, wisecracking, driven, troubled, and brilliant writers and editors. He introduces us to Wolcott Gibbs, theater critic, all-around wit, and author of an infamous 1936 parody of <i>Time</i> magazine. We meet the demanding and eccentric founding editor, Harold Ross, who would routinely tell his underlings, \"I'm firing you because you are not a genius\" and who once mailed a pair of his underwear to Walter Winchell, who had accused him of preferring to go bare bottomed under his slacks. </p> <p>Joining the cast are the mercurial, blind James Thurber, a brilliant cartoonist and wildly inventive fabulist; and the enigmatic E. B. White - an incomparable prose stylist and Ross' favorite son - who married <i>The New Yorker</i>'s formidable fiction editor, Katharine Angell. Then there is the dashing St. Clair McKelway, who was married five times and claimed to have no fewer than 12 personalities but was nonetheless a superb reporter and managing editor alike. Many of these characters became legends in their own rights, but Vinciguerra also shows how, as a group, <i>The New Yorker</i>'s inner circle brought forth a profound transformation in how life was perceived, interpreted, written about, and published in America. </p> <p><i>Cast of Characters</i> may be the most revealing - and entertaining - book yet about the unique personalities who built what Ross called not a magazine but a \"movement\". </p>";
