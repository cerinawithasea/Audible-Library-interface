Imprisoned with her, seemingly at random, are four men. The only way out is the trapdoor in the ceiling â€“ and it's locked.</p> <p>The single clue about what brings them all here is a cryptic message sprayed onto one wall. Connect the dots. Repent. A camera fixed high above reach is livestreaming this whole nightmare to the world. What confessions are they meant to make to their unseen audience?</p> <p>With only a single lighter between them and the cellar steadily filling with water, Eva races to discover what connects her to the four men. But nobody here is who they claim to be. And in this dark place, secrets and lies are so much easier to tell than the truth that could destroy them all.</p>";
