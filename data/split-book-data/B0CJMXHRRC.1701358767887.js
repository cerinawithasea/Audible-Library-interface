window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms. There’s been a lot of discussion in the medical world lately about the potential benefits of these and other drugs for certain medical conditions, such as anxiety and depression. As we consider the place of psychedelics in the future, we can draw insight and guidance from the history of how psychedelics have been described, sought after, applied, and prohibited over the centuries.</p> <p>Erika Dyck, professor of history at the University of Saskatchewan, introduces you to the world of hallucinogens, from the sacred rituals of Indigenous cultures to their role in the social upheavals of the 1960s to the current interest in their potential therapeutic applications. Over six mind-expanding lessons, she’ll cover sacred plants, ayahuasca, mescaline, LSD, mushrooms, and others, looking at the origins, uses, potential, and science behind each.</p> <p>You will see how psychedelics have broadened horizons and inspired new insights, often in the face of deep-seated prejudice and fear.</p>";
