window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Essential to understanding Southeast Asia in the 21st century, <i>Hello, Shadowlands</i> reveals a booming underworld of organised crime across a region in flux - a $100 billion trade that deals in narcotics, animals and people - and the staggering human toll that is being steadily ignored by the West. From Myanmar’s anarchic hills to the swamplands of Vietnam, jihadis are being pitted against brothel workers, pet thieves against vigilantes and meth barons against Christian vice squads.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Hello, Shadowlands</i> takes a deep plunge into crime rings both large and small. It also examines how China’s rise and America’s decline are creating new opportunities for transnational syndicates to thrive. Focusing on human stories on both sides of this crime wave, the acclaimed Bangkok-based broadcaster and journalist Patrick Winn intimately profiles the men and women of the region who are forced to make agonizing choices in the absence of law.&nbsp;</p>";
