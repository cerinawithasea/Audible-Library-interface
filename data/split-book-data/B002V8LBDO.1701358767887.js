window.bookSummaryJSON = "A professor emeritus of philosophy at Princeton University, Harry G. Frankfurt penned a surprise smash hit with his <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>On Bullshit</i>, which insightfully and wittily captured the human capacity for, and tendency toward, BS. Now he examines the other side of the coin with this equally entertaining and provocative follow-up. <p> As Frankfurt showed previously, bullshit lies within the realm of subjective perception. Truth, then, is what we find beyond this realm. But are we, as a people, willing to allow ourselves to be governed by honest principles? Could it be possible that we lack the commitment to acting morally and truthfully?</p> <p> Using his trademark skill at sharing philosophical insights with a general audience, Frankfurt examines these and other questions in this informative audiobook.</p>";
