window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some fly; some web sling. Some wield magic lassos; some throw magic hammers. Some work in the shadows; some operate in broad daylight. But whatever their powers and weapons and methods, there’s one thing comic-book superheroes have in common: They’re everywhere.</p> <p>Why do characters like Spider-Man, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, Batman, Black Panther, and Superman still draw our attention decades after their creation? Why are film and television audiences—not to mention legions of comic-book readers—still enamored with their stories?</p> <p>In Lan Dong’s Audible Original, <i>The History of the Superhero</i>, examine the roots of the superhero dynamic that’s overtaking popular culture. Encompassing both Marvel Comics’ and DC Comics’ pantheon of extraordinary heroes, these eight lectures explore how superhero comics came to be, how famous characters (and their exploits) evolved in response to social and cultural changes, how superhero cinematic universes have become an integral (and highly lucrative) part of film history, and why superheroes of all types are likely here to stay.</p> <p>Get ready for an exciting, eye-opening pop culture adventure. No disguise required.</p>";
