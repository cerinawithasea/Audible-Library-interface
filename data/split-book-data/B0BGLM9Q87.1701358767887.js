window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With an introduction by Clementine Ford.</p> <p>For years, Amy Thunig thought she knew all the details about the day she was born, often demanding that the story of her birth be retold. Years later, heavily pregnant with her own first child, she learns what really happened that day. It’s a tale that exemplifies many of the events of her early life, where circumstances sometimes dictated that things be slightly different from how they might seem–including what is meant by her dad being away for ‘work’ and why her legal last name differs from her family’s.</p> <p>In this remarkable memoir, Amy narrates her journey through childhood and adolescence, growing up with parents who struggled with addiction and incarceration. She reveals the importance of extended family and community networks when your immediate loved ones are dealing with endemic poverty and intergenerational trauma. In recounting her experiences, she shows how the stories we tell about ourselves can help to shape and sustain us. <i>Tell Me Again</i> will captivate, move and inspire listeners with its candour and insight.</p> <p>Dr Amy Thunig (B.Arts, M.Teach, PhD) is a <i>Gomeroi/Gamilaroi/Kamilaroi yinarr</i> (woman) and mother who resides on the unceded lands of the Awabakal peoples. An academic in the field of education, Amy is also a Director at Story Factory in Redfern, and in 2019 gave their TEDx talk ‘Disruption is not a dirty word’. As well as being on various committees and councils, Amy is a media commentator and panellist, regularly appearing on television programs such as ABC’s <i>The Drum</i>, and writing for publications such as <i>Buzzfeed</i>, <i>Sydney Book Review</i>, <i>IndigenousX</i>, <i>The Guardian</i> and more.</p>";
