window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Doctors are more than doctors. They’re detectives who solve mysteries about the human body.</p> <p>Diagnosing patients is about looking for clues, whether a persistent tickle in the back of the throat or confusion and memory loss. Just like detectives, good doctors sift through information until they arrive at the medical solution that fits best.</p> <p>Think you have what it takes to keep up with medical detective work? Find out with this second installment of Dr. Roy Benaroch’s thrilling look at medical mysteries from across history. Continuing the excitement of his earlier Audible Original, <i>Medical Mysteries Across History, Pt.2 </i>features cases involving ancient kings and military leaders, beloved philosophers and popular entertainers. You may know who some of these patients are - but you’ve almost certainly never heard their stories told from a doctor’s point of view.</p> <p>In each instance, you’ll learn about the medicine that was practiced during the patient’s life, and you’ll discover how modern medicine can shed light on the past. You’ll see how every life (and every disease) is a story and that these stories reveal the clues doctors need to make an accurate diagnosis. And you’ll discover that while a lot in medicine has certainly changed, the way doctors approach patients hasn’t changed very much at all.</p> <p>Think you can guess who these 10 mystery patients are? Pay attention. The medical and historical hints are there and waiting for you.</p>";
