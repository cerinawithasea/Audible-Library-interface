window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The new Bates Motel is a tourist attraction, a re-creation of the infamous murder site, and the developers are already counting their profits. But there’s a new exhibit that nobody expected: the bloody corpse of a teenage girl crumpled in the front hall, stabbed to death. Among the avalanche of press and publicity is reporter and true-crime book writer Amelia Haines, who is studying the original Psycho killings. To her, the new murders are a golden opportunity; if she can become part of the investigation, perhaps track down the killer herself, then her fame and fortune will be assured. But catching the madman won’t be easy: the town is full of suspects, and Amy’s best informants keep turning up murdered. If she isn’t careful, Amelia Haines may become the next permanent guest at the Bates Motel.&nbsp;</p> <p>Robert Bloch (1917-1994) was a horror, suspense, and science fiction writer and screenwriter, best known for the novel <i>Psycho</i>.
