window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We are surrounded by real-life stories of white-collar crime, with pharmaceutical executives going to jail for their roles in the opioid crisis, titans of Wall Street prosecuted for insider trading and securities fraud, and senior government officials charged with fraud and corruption. But although it’s widespread, a fascinating aspect of white-collar crime is just how blurry its boundaries are.</p> <p>In 24 lessons, consider the characteristics of white-collar crime that set it apart from other areas of criminal law. Early lessons offer you a foundational understanding of the nature and tools of federal white-collar prosecutions, including the role of federal prosecutors, federal grand juries, subpoenas and search warrants, and the federal criminal justice system. At the heart of this series: in-depth looks at the most common white-collar offenses, including mail and wire fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, money laundering, insider trading, and extortion.</p> <p>Professor Eliason’s legal expertise in the area of white-collar criminal law, combined with his background as an assistant United States attorney for the District of Columbia, transforms what would be, in lesser hands, dry legal lectures into eye-opening investigations into some of the greatest crimes in US history, involving infamous figures such as financial fraudster Bernie Madoff and former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
