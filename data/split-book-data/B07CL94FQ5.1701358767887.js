window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Punk Avenue</i> is an intimate look at author Paris-born Phil Marcade's first ten years in the United States where he drifted from Boston to the West Coast and back, before winding up in New York City and becoming immersed in the early punk rock scene.</p> <p>From backrooms of Max's and CBGB's to the Tropicana Hotel in Los Angeles and back, <i>Punk Avenue </i>is a tour de force of stories from someone at the heart of the era. With brilliant, often hilarious prose, Marcade relays first-hand tales about spending a Provincetown summer with photographer Nan Goldin and actor-writer Cookie Mueller, having the Ramones play their very first gig at his party, working with Blondie's Debbie Harry on French lyrics for her songs, enjoying Thanksgiving with Johnny Thunders' mother, and starting the beloved NYC punk-blues band The Senders.</p>";
