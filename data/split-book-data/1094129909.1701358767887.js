window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. </b></p> <p>George Orwell once wrote of a world where abuse of power begins with an abuse of language and a bastardization of truth. Some of today's most exciting voices in speculative fiction explore the ramifications of those ideas in <i>Ignorance Is Strength</i>.</p> <p>The Dystopia Triptych is a series of three anthologies of dystopian fiction. <i>Ignorance Is Strength</i> - before the dystopia - focuses on society during its descent into absurdity and madness. <i>Burn the Ashes</i> - during the dystopia - turns its attention to life during the strangest, most dire times. <i>Or Else the Light</i> - after the dystopia - concludes the saga with each author sharing their own vision of how we as a society might crawl back from the precipice of despair.</p> <p><i>Ignorance Is Strength</i> features all-new, never-before-published works by the following authors, in order of appearance: Carrie Vaughn, Tim Pratt, Rich Larson, Cadwell Turnbull, Karin Lowachee, Adam-Troy Castro, Caroline M. Yoachim, Hugh Howey, An Owomoyela, Seanan McGuire, Dominica Phetteplace, Alex Irvine, Tobias S. Buckell, Scott Sigler, Darcie Little Badger, Violet Allen, and Merc Fenn Wolfmoor.</p>";
