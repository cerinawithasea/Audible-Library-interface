window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This devastating book illuminates America's gun culture - its manufacturers, dealers, buffs, and propagandists - but also offers concrete solutions to our national epidemic of death by firearm. It begins with an account of a crime that is by now almost commonplace: on December 16, 1988, 16-year-old Nicholas Elliot walked into his Virginia high school with a Cobray M-11/9 and several hundred rounds of ammunition tucked in his backpack. By day's end, he had killed one teacher and severely wounded another.&nbsp;</p> <p>In<i> Lethal Passage</i> Erik Larson shows us how a disturbed teenager was able to buy a weapon advertised as \"the gun that made the 80s roar.\" The result is a book that can - and should - save lives, and that has already become an essential text in the gun-control debate.</p>";
