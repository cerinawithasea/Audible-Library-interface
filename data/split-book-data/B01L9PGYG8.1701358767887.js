window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Discover the stories of 12 women who heard the call to settle the West and who came from all points of the globe to begin their journeys. </p> <p>As a slave Clara watched helplessly as her husband and children were sold, only to be reunited with her youngest daughter as a free woman six decades later. </p> <p>As a young girl, Charlotte hid her gender to escape a life of poverty and became the greatest stagecoach driver who ever lived. </p> <p>As a Native American, Gertrude fought to give her people a voice and to educate leaders about the ways and importance of America's native people. </p> <p>These are gripping miniature dramas of good-hearted women, selfless providers, courageous immigrants and migrants, and women with skills too innumerable to list. Many were crusaders for social justice and women's rights. All endured hardships, overcame obstacles, broke barriers, and changed the world. The author ties the stories of these pioneer women to the experiences of women today with the hope that they will be inspired to live boldly and bravely and to fill their own lives with vision, faith, and fortitude. To live with grit. </p>";
