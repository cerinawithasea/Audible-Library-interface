window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over 60 years after Virginia Woolf drowned in the River Ouse, Olivia Laing set out one midsummer morning to walk its banks, from source to sea. Along the way, she explores the roles that rivers play in human lives, tracing their intricate flow through literature, mythology, and folklore.</p> <p>Lyrical and stirring, <i>To the River</i> is a passionate investigation into how history resides in a landscape - and how ghosts never quite leave the places they love.</p>";
