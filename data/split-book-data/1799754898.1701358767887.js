window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the #1 bestseller </b><b><i>StrengthsFinder 2.0</i></b><b> comes a moving memoir and inspiring call to action for bettering your own life by doing your best for others.</b></p> <p>Life is not about you. It’s about what you do for others. That’s the realization that has driven Tom Rath - the mega-bestselling expert in self-development research - to evolve his focus from one’s inward search for strength to the larger outward search for purposeful contribution to others. <i>It’s Not About You</i> is a short introduction to the next chapter in the life and career of perhaps our greatest living self-help writer.</p> <p>Diagnosed with a rare genetic condition at age sixteen, Tom’s awareness of his own mortality drove him to pursue a meaningful life in the nurturing care of his family, including his eventual mentor and collaborator, Tom’s grandfather Don Clifton. In this empowering hybrid of a self-help memoir, Tom remembers and celebrates his greatest teacher as he emphatically encourages each and every one of us to answer life’s great question: What can <i>I</i> put into the world?</p>";
