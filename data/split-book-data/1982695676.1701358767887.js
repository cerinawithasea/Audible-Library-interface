window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's the worst Nazi war criminal you've never heard of </b></p> <p>Sidekick to SS Chief Heinrich Himmler and supervisor of Nazi rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, General Hans Kammler was responsible for the construction of Hitler's slave labor sites and concentration camps. He personally altered the design of Auschwitz to increase crowding, ensuring that epidemic diseases would complement the work of the gas chambers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why has the world forgotten this monster? Kammler was declared dead after the war. But the aide who testified to Kammler's supposed \"suicide\" never produced the general's dog tags or any other proof of death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dean Reuter, Colm Lowery, and Keith Chester have spent decades on the trail of the elusive Kammler, uncovering documents unseen since the 1940s and visiting the purported site of Kammler's death, now in the Czech Republic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their astonishing discovery: US government documents prove that Hans Kammler was in American custody for months after the war - well after his officially declared suicide.&nbsp;</p> <p>And what happened to him after that? Kammler was kept out of public view, never indicted or tried, but to what end? Did he cooperate with Nuremberg prosecutors investigating Nazi war crimes? Was he protected so the United States could benefit from his intimate knowledge of the Nazi rocket program and Germany's secret weapons?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Hidden Nazi</i> is true history more harrowing - and shocking - than the most thrilling fiction.&nbsp;</p>";
