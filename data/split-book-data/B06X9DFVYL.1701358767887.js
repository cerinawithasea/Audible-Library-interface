Unfortunately for Eden Kendrick, a new enemy threatens her beloved kingdom, one more dangerous and deadly than ever before. After enjoying a deliciously elongated honeymoon, Eden returns to the Citadel with her husband and happiness intact. She's unexpectedly pregnant, but that's just one more blessing to add to her blooming happiness. </p><p>Eden's heart is full and her endless life has never been happier. That is until Dmitri Terletov returns from the dead and threatens everyone she loves and the kingdom she worked so hard to build. This time around, Eden is supposed to be shielded from the conflict. She has her growing babies to protect now and Kiran wants her as far from the battle as possible. Although she's a little stir-crazy with idle hands, she agrees that keeping away from Terletov and his deadly experiments is definitely the right course of action. </p><p>Unfortunately, Terletov doesn't agree. And when he arrives at the Castle, uninvited and desperate for the magic Eden once stole from him, she has no choice but to fight once again to save the people she was born to protect. </p>";
