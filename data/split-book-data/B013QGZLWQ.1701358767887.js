window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Leah Thornton’s life, like her <i>Southern Living</i> home, has great curb appeal. But a paralyzing encounter with a can of frozen apple juice in the supermarket shatters the façade, forcing her to admit that all is not as it appears. When her best friend gets in Leah’s face about her refusal to deal with her life and her drinking, Leah is forced to make a decision. Can this brand-conscious socialite walk away from the country club into 28 days of rehab? Can she leave what she has now to gain back what she needs? Joy, sadness, pain, and a new strength converge, testing her marriage, her friendships, and her faith. </p>";
