Now in her 50s, Calamity is confronting two big life transitions: the death of her beloved father and the beginning of menopause, a physical shift that has rekindled her special gift for finding lost things. <p> Suddenly, she is getting hot flashes that seem to forge objects out of thin air. Only this time, the lost item that has washed up on the shore is not her old toy truck or her hairbrush, but a four-year-old boy.</p> <p>As Calamity takes the child into her care, she discovers that all is not as it seems: the boy's family is most unusual. Then, Calamity must reawaken to the mysteries surrounding her own childhood and the early disappearance of her mother.</p>";
