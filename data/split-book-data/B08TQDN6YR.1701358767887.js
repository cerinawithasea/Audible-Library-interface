window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This Southern, paranormally charged, pulp-fiction thriller takes listeners through the dense woodland and harsh humidity near the Georgia/Florida border, where a ruthless police Captain brutally sustains his local empire.&nbsp;</p> <p>Helping to enforce the Captain's will are his two proteges, Cliff Ramos and Cooper Cornelius Happenstance, known better as Coop.</p> <p>Ramos is a brilliant and sadistic detective that has always felt apart from the norms of humanity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Coop is Ramos's older, and very animalistic, mentor, whose instincts are never questioned.</p> <p>Both men have the unique ability to always find trouble, and are in a constant battle with themselves to either accept the demonic urges inside them, or fight to embrace a long-lost humanity in an attempt to reclaim their souls.&nbsp;</p> <p>But is there a way to do both?</p> <p>When a bizarre murder takes place in a corporate office, Coop's daughter Sam is a potential suspect. He and Ramos are called to action, and since Ramos still longs for the days when he and Sam were lovers, he will protect her at any cost.</p> <p>Who is responsible for this cleverly crafted murder? Is it Woody, Sam's estranged eco-terrorist husband and father to her child? Could it be a local Warlord, The Viking, striking back at Coop for brutally murdering most of his crime syndicate years before? Or does the trail lead closer to home, not only implicating Sam - but even Ramos and Coop?</p> <p>This tale unfolds to hilarious, dark, and violent chapters of human greed, animal desires, and possibly the paranormal, as Ramos, Coop, and the Captain work to protect the people they love, while also maintaining their grip on reality, and ultimately - their sanity.</p>";
