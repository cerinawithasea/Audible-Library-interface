No. <p> Before you know it, I'm being chased by an ugly thug with a gun, and a bullet blasts its way through my back, and, believe it or not, nothing happened. I survived! How? You guessed it. I, Jack Fleming, ace reporter, have been transformed into a vampire, which has its advantages. You never die, you never grow old, you sleep all day, and, best of all, you can hunt down your own murderer.</p> <p> <i>Bloodlist</i> is the first novel in an exciting vampire adventure series. </p>";
