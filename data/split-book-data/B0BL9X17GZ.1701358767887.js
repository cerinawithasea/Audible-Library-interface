window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Did you know that the CIA had sabotaged ISRO’s top secret operation to transfer cryogenic rocket technology from Russia to India? Ever wondered what is the real reason why S. Nambi Narayanan does not want the whole truth behind the ISRO spy story to surface?</p> <p>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was rocked by a spy case in 1994, taking down in its wake six persons who were a part of the organisation, including S. Nambi Narayanan. They were blamed with passing critical rocket technology to a neighbouring nation and booked for the same. <i>Classified </i>exposes the hidden truths behind the spy story and how it highlighted the fractures of our premier institutions. It shows us how the spy case stripped them bare, down to their bones. Listen to this intriguing account of how state agencies are surreptitiously trying to bury the wreckage of a failed operation.</p>";
