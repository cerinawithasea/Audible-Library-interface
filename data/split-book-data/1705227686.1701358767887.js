window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"It took hitting rock bottom for me to realize that if I wanted something better for my girls, I had to learn to love myself first.\"</p> <p>Leah was first thrust under the reality television microscope when her teen pregnancy was documented on MTV's groundbreaking series <i>16 and Pregnant</i>. Since then, fans of <i>Teen Mom 2</i> have watched her life play out on the small screen - from her struggle to rise to the challenges of motherhood, through her harrowing journey to find a diagnosis for one of her twin girls with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, and the collapse of two marriages. She has learned to live under the harsh glare of media scrutiny, yet there is a truth behind the reality that the cameras have never revealed.</p> <p>In her unflinching and honest memoir, Leah takes listeners behind the scenes and shares an intimate, often heartbreaking, portrait of her turbulent childhood in rural West Virginia, the rock bottom that forced her to reevaluate her life, and her triumphant break from toxic relationships and self-destructive cycles to live her life with hope, grace, and faith.</p>";
