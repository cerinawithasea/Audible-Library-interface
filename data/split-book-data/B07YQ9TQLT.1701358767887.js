window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>About this Audible Original</p> <p>From podcasts and documentaries to online forums, true crime is booming. But as one Audible editor and self-professed crime obsessive observes, the genre is being pulled in new and different directions along with a changing social landscape. She wanted to know: Can we ethically engage in true crime as real concerns surface around the crimes, victims, and systemic issues that directly impact the humans we are hearing about? Where are the most sensitive and original voices in true crime turning their attention? And how can we use our primal fascination with the dark side of human nature as a force for good?</p> <p>Listen in on this exclusive conversation with a host of experts from the true crime landscape, featuring original interviews with the following guests:</p> <p>Attica Locke, author, <i>Heaven, My Home</i></p> <p>Billy Jensen, author, <i>Chase Darkness with Me</i></p> <p>Emily Martinez, executive producer, <i>Finding Tess</i></p> <p>Jim Clemente, creator, <i>Call Me God</i></p> <p>Marcus Parks, creator, <i>Last Podcast on the Left</i></p> <p>Michele Josue, director, <i>Happy Jail</i></p> <p>Maureen O’Connell, narrator, <i>Call Me God</i></p> <p>Rachel McCarthy James, author, <i>The Man from the Train</i></p> <p>Rachel Monroe, author, <i>Savage Appetites</i></p> <p>Sarah Weinman, author, <i>The Real Lolita</i></p> <p>Scott Brick, narrator, <i>In Cold Blood</i></p> <p>Vanessa Harris, senior director, Audible Content Partnerships</p> <p><b>Please note: </b><b><i>Murder, We Spoke</i></b><b> contains some adult language and mature themes.
