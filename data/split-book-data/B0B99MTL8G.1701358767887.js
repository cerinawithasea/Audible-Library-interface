window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle called man a political animal. But what did he mean by that? What is democracy? How do democracies differ from one another? How do they stack up against their alternatives, like dictatorship? And can democracy survive the many challenges it faces today?</p> <p>To answer these questions, look no further than Democracy and Its Alternatives. Political science, history, and current affairs rolled into one, these 24 lectures investigate democratic government in theory and practice. With political scientist Ethan Hollander as your expert guide, you will explore democracy from all available angles, embarking on an intensive intellectual journey that leaves no stone unturned. And you will do all of this with a robust toolbox of political philosophy, world history, international relations, individual case studies, and carefully constructed thought experiments.</p> <p>From the provisioning of public goods to the enforcement of laws, learn about the role that governments play in our everyday lives. Reduce politics down to decision-making processes and see how these decisions can take shape with sharply constructed scenarios. Explore the differences between democracy and dictatorship, superpowers and failed states. Investigate democracy’s most dangerous flaws, from inefficiency and gridlock to the prospect of mob rule. Examine how democracies contend with problems like ethnic conflict, extremism, populism, polarization, power imbalances, and more. Dive into the theories that justify government and legitimize democracy. Zoom in and out of case studies across history and around the world to see how democracies differ from each other. And walk away armed with a foundational understanding of government, politics, and international relations.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
