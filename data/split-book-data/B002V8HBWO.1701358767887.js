window.bookSummaryJSON = "This explosive new audiobook challenges many of the long-held assumptions about blacks, about Jews, about Germans and Nazis, about slavery, and about education. Plainly written, powerfully reasoned, and backed with a startling array of documented facts, <i>Black Rednecks and White Liberals</i> takes on the trendy intellectuals of our times as well as historic interpreters of American life. <p> Through a series of essays, Sowell presents an in-depth look at key beliefs behind many policies and trends. He presents eye-opening insights into the development of the ghetto culture, a culture cheered on toward self-destruction by white liberals who consider themselves \"friends\" of blacks.</p> <p> <i>Black Rednecks and White Liberals</i> is the capstone of decades of outstanding research and writing on racial and cultural issues by Thomas Sowell.</p>";
