window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ashville is a town with a secret history. Ancient structures lie hidden in the woods, and strange rituals are performed to keep the dead where they belong. For gravedigger Abel Cunningham, it is also a town filled with regrets. And when Abel is tasked with an unusual burial, he discovers there are more than just corpses in the cemetery.<br> <br> Set in an unsettling vision of the Old West, <b><i>Almost Ruth</i></b> is the new nightmare from the author of <b><i>Criterium</i></b> and <b><i>The Dark Side of the Room</i></b>.<br> <br> “Tyler Jones writes with the lyrical complexity and haunting tenderness of masters like Matheson and Straub while remaining entirely new and inventive. A true visionary of contemporary horror fiction.” (<b>Eric LaRocca, author of </b><b><i>Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke)</i></b><br> <br> \"Tyler Jones shows us in <i>Almost Ruth</i> that he is a fierce talent in the horror genre and one not to be missed, with prose as sharp as a scalpel he cuts us wide open and pours salt into our wounds. This book broke something in me and I fear I’ll never be whole again. Jones is unmistakably one of the brightest lights in indie horror right now, read his words and be transformed.\" (<b>Ross Jeffery, Bram Stoker Nominated author of</b><b><i> Tome,</i></b><b> </b><b><i>Juniper,</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Only The Stains Remain)</i></b><br> <br> <i>\"Almost Ruth</i> is rooted in humanity. With unmatched depth and painstaking beauty, Jones crafts a story focused on small town rituals reminiscent of Shirley Jackson. One that will keep your gears turning and your blood chilled long after the last page.\" (<b>Brennan LaFaro, author of </b><b><i>Slattery Falls)</i></b></p>";
