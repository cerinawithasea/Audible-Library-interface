window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For thousands of years, the human mind has been shrouded in mystery. But with the latest advancements in both our understanding of the brain and the technology we use to look inside it, scientists have vastly improved their grasp of the human mind. Now, more than at any other point in human history, we can better explain and describe how the human mind has evolved; how our genes and environments work together to mold the people we become; and the sources, symptoms, and potential treatment methods for debilitating mental disorders like depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and many others. </p> <p>The human mind and its complexities lie at the heart of who we are as human beings. And grasping its origins, no matter how mysterious they can sometimes be, is essential to a well-rounded understanding of answers to questions that have fascinated and perplexed humanity throughout history. </p> <p>This 24-lecture series is your guide to the latest information and viewpoints on what scientists know about this fascinating subject. Taught by an award-winning teacher whose training as a clinical psychologist straddles both the science of the mind and its impact on individual lives, their comprehensive approach reveals how that science applies to the life of our species - and to your own life as well. </p> <p>The lectures explore theories about how the mind works on both an evolutionary and individual scale. Each offers its own fascinating insights. But by examining them both individually and together, Professor Hinshaw reveals similarities and differences in viewpoints and approaches that wouldn't be apparent from a focus on just one - providing you with the best possible picture about what the mind truly is.</p>";
