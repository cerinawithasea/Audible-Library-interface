window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meet Brooke: a bisexual Bridget Jones, a millennial Meg Ryan, a girl standing in front of a boy asking him—wait, it doesn’t have to be a boy? For Brooke, ‘The One’ could be anyone. As long as it’s the type of (actually highly problematic) movie love she’s watched on repeat since she was a little girl. Brooke writes algorithms for a dating app, which is odd given what a hopeless romantic she is. But in the wake of a devastating breakup and with her 30th birthday looming, it seems Brooke has no choice but to do something she’s never done before: put her own algorithms to the test.... Based on the award-winning sell-out Edinburgh Fringe &amp; Soho Theatre show, <i>Algorithms</i> is a brave, bold and brilliantly funny comedy-drama about dating beyond the binary.</p> <p>Starring Sadie Clark as Brooke, Alison Steadman as Lucinda, Seyan Sarvan as Amira, Len Gwyn as Frankie, Desiree Burch as Katya, Ciara Baxendale as Josie, Joe Thomas as Charlie and an ensemble cast.</p> <p>Directed by Lisa Spirling with original score by Tawiah.</p> <p><b><i>Algorithms </i></b><b>is intended for an adult audience as it contains scenes of an explicit sexual nature and strong language. Listener discretion is advised.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sadie Clark: Sadie is an award-winning writer, actor and comedy improviser. Her first full-length play, <i>Algorithms, </i>sold out at the Edinburgh Fringe (2019) and Soho Theatre (2020), it won the TV Foundation’s ‘Stage to Screen’ New Voice Award (2020) and was long-listed for the Tony Craze Award (2018). She is an alumni of Soho Theatre Writers Lab (2018), BFI Network x BAFTA Crew (2021) and Mercury Theatre Playwrights (2022). Sadie was named one of <i>The Guardian</i>’s ‘12 Theatre Stars of 2020’ where they cited <i>Algorithms</i> as ‘astonishingly assured and practically broadcast-ready...sweet, sad and, as performed by Clark herself, full of heart–with more than a touch of Miranda Hart too’. Her first two-hander, <i>Gemini</i>, inspired by her experience growing up between London and Norfolk, is currently in development with support from Mercury Theatre and HighTide. It explores queer identity in rural areas, farming and the climate crisis. She is also developing <i>Greedy</i>, a multi-disciplinary piece about desire, lies and willpower, with the support of director Hannah Hauer-King, dramaturg Jules Kelly, Soho Theatre, The Corn Hall and the Arts Council England. After gaining a first in Natural Science at UEA Sadie trained as an actor with Fourth Monkey Theatre Company. She has also trained in long-form improv with Monkey Toast, The Free Association and The Groundlings. She performs regularly on the London improv scene with the all-queer female/non-binary team ‘Hell Yeah’ and as part of the duo ‘A Little Bit of Tender’.</p>";
