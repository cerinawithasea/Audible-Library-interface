window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From a stunning new voice in YA literature comes an epic, utterly unforgettable contemporary novel about a lost shipwreck, a missing piece of family history, and weathering the storms of life.</b></p> <p>The Larkin family isn't just lucky - they <i>persevere</i>. At least that's what Violet and her younger brother, Sam, were always told. When the <i>Lyric</i> sank off the coast of Maine, their great-great-great grandmother didn't drown like the rest of the passengers. No, Fidelia swam to shore, fell in love, and founded Lyric, Maine, the town Violet and Sam returned to every summer.</p> <p>But wrecks seem to run in the family: Tall, funny, musical Violet can't stop partying with the wrong people. And, one beautiful summer day, brilliant, sensitive Sam attempts to take his own life.</p> <p>Shipped back to Lyric while Sam is in treatment, Violet is haunted by her family's missing piece - the lost shipwreck she and Sam dreamed of discovering when they were children. Desperate to make amends, Violet embarks on a wildly ambitious mission: locate the <i>Lyric</i>, lain hidden in a watery grave for over a century.</p> <p>She finds a fellow wreck hunter in Liv Stone, an amateur local historian whose sparkling intelligence and guarded gray eyes make Violet ache in an exhilarating new way. Whether or not they find the <i>Lyric</i>, the journey Violet takes - and the bridges she builds along the way - may be the start of something like survival.</p> <p>Epic, funny, and sweepingly romantic, <i>The Last True Poets of the Sea</i> is an astonishing debut about the strength it takes to swim up from a wreck.</p>";
