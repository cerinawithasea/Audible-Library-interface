window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Following the success of <i>If You Only Knew</i> and <i>On Second Thought</i> comes the highly anticipated new novel by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Higgins - a funny and bittersweet story of a woman who returns to her hometown after a decade's absence hoping to resuscitate her relationship with her family, only to discover that her homecoming is not as welcome as she had imagined. </p> <p>It's been over a decade since Nora left her hometown of Scupper Island, Maine, and very seldom looked back. She's carved out a successful life in Boston, where no one knows her as the awkward girl with the delinquent sister and the dad who left, but a not-as-dramatic-as-it-sounds brush with death has her taking stock of her life. Inspired to reconnect with her prickly mother and snarky teenage niece, Nora returns home for the summer, where she's forced to face the people she's spent the last ten years trying to avoid and where some revelations about her family could either heal her or send her scrambling back to Boston on the next ferry. </p>";
