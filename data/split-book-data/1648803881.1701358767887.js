window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A new breed of terror that rises from the depths of the ocean. To hunt. To devour. To kill.</p> <p>The first attack occurs in the underwater caverns of the Bahamas. Two professional divers exploring the unknown. A monstrous flesh-ripping predator they never see coming.</p> <p>Now the attacks are coming closer and closer to shore. A sun-soaked playground for sea-loving tourists. A human feasting ground for whatever lurks beneath.</p> <p>Now, in a desperate race against time, Eric Watson, an expert on remote control underwater vehicles, and marine biologist Valerie Martell, must identify a savage new species of killer — and piece together one of nature’s most horrific mysteries. But the most terrifying discovery of all waits for Val and her team at the bottom of the sea. A discovery too shocking to comprehend.</p> <p>Because up 'til now, this creature existed only in mankind’s darkest nightmares. Not anymore.</p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Nanna Ingvarsson, Patrick Bussink, Evan Casey, James Konicek, Deidra Starnes, Andy Brownstein, James Lewis, Dexter Hamlett, KenYatta Rogers, Thomas Keegan, Michael Glenn, Ericka Rose, Colleen Delany, David Jourdan, Dawn Ursula, Yasmin Tuazon, Nanette Savard, Michael John Casey, Scott McCormick, Richard Rohan.</p>";
