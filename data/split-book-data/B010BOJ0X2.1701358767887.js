window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the epigraph to this volume, Penelope Fitzgerald tells us, \"If a story begins with finding, it must end with searching\". And so we discover each story here to follow the arc of a search, just as each also contains a rescue. What is immediately apparent is that it will be impossible to guess the form this rescue will take or even who it is who'll require it. </p><p>Instead the astonishingly talented Valerie Trueblood has imbued each story with its own depth and mystery, so rescue comes as a surprise to the listener, who is in intimate sympathy for the soul in extremity. And these are diverse characters whose fates, in lesser hands, might be thought of as hopeless: the fired cop turned security guard, the stolid 19-year-old nurses' aide who will not be going to art school, the cynical radio producer who is dying of breast cancer and on a plane on her way to Lourdes. </p><p>In these 13 stories, linked by a common transcendent human genius, the writing is confident, clear, original, and often drop-dead stunning - as if the stories are being told by the most casually eloquent among us. </p>";
