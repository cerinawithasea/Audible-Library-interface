After a three-year hiatus he’s back, more violent than ever. And with three bodies discovered in just two weeks, it’s clear that he’s escalating.&nbsp;</p> <p>Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Ethan Manning is short on leads. What he needs is a proper task force and more resources. What he gets is Dr. Alexa Hayden, a forensic consultant from the States. A woman he hasn’t seen in 20 years, one with whom he shares a history. He still bears the scars.&nbsp;</p> <p>Returning to Nova Scotia is harder than Alexa expected, and working alongside Ethan threatens to reopen old wounds. But she’ll allow nothing to shake her focus. Until she finds herself the killer’s newest obsession. Now she and Ethan will have to confront their past in order to predict the man’s next move. The Tailor will leave no sin unpunished, and his unholy crusade has marked Alexa for death.</p>";
