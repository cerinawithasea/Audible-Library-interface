window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this \"meticulously researched\" account (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>), a Pulitzer Prize-winning author examines the dangers of a failing public health system unequipped to handle large-scale global risks like a coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Coming Plague</i>, Laurie Garrett takes on perhaps the most crucial global issue of our time in this eye-opening book. She asks: Is our collective health in a state of decline? If so, how dire is this crisis, and has the public health system itself contributed to it? Using riveting detail and finely honed storytelling, exploring outbreaks around the world, Garrett exposes the underbelly of the world's globalization to find out if it can still be assumed that government can and will protect the people's health or if that trust has been irrevocably broken.</p>";
