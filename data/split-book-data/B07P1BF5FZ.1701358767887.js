window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you saw <i>Afflicted</i>, the documentary series on Netflix, and now think chronic fatigue syndrome is a fake disease that only affects \"drama queens\", you are sadly mistaken. As you will learn in Charles Ortleb's historically important audiobook, chronic fatigue syndrome is a potentially fatal illness that is contagious and linked to a deadly virus now suspected to be the cause of many immunological illnesses. The fact that doctors and nurses often come down with chronic fatigue syndrome should have made it clear long ago that chronic fatigue syndrome is contagious.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fact that sexual partners of chronic fatigue syndrome patients contract the illness should also have made it clear it is contagious, as well as the fact that entire families and friends have come down with it. And, as this audiobook makes clear, the fact that the pets of people sick with chronic fatigue syndrome also get the illness should have made it painfully obvious that the world is dealing with a unique and terrifying pathogen.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an audiobook based on the investigative reporting of <i>New York Native</i>, a brilliant and uncompromising little newspaper that pioneered the coverage of both AIDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. Back in the '80s, <i>Rolling Stone</i> said Charles Ortleb's newspaper deserved a Pulitzer Prize, and Randy Shilts gave the newspaper high praise in his best seller <i>And the Band Played On</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a must-hear audiobook for anyone who wants to know the disturbing history of the chronic fatigue syndrome epidemic. Why have the CDC and NIH pretended that the communicable disease fraudulently called \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" is a mystery for over three decades? By the end of this audiobook of inconvenient truths, the answer is crystal clear.</p>";
