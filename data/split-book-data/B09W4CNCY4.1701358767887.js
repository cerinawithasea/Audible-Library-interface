window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of <i>Buried Deep</i> and <i>The House on the Water</i> comes a shocking thriller about a young podcaster who’s investigating a cold case in her hometown and determined to uncover the truth at any cost.&nbsp;</p> <p>Paige Barrett was living her dream as a journalist in New York City, racking up bylines as a staff writer at<i> The Razor</i>, a cutting-edge online magazine. But when she’s suddenly fired from her job and dumped by her boyfriend, she finds herself back home in the quaint seaside town of Shoreham, Florida, waiting tables and living in her sister’s guesthouse.&nbsp;</p> <p>Restless and itching for something meaningful to occupy her time, she decides to launch a true-crime podcast about the death of Jessica Cady, a beloved teacher who died mysteriously 20 years earlier. The case went cold with no leads and no suspects, but the more Paige digs into the woman’s death, the closer she comes to a killer. In a small town like Shoreham, it’s impossible to keep a secret forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Tell Her Story</i> is performed by Dakota Fanning and features the voices of LJ Ganser, Vikas Adam, Emily Bauer, Ann Osmond, Fred Berman, Jonathan Davis, and Laura Darrell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
