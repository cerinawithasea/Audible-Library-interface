window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"A lucid presentation of what progressive education can accomplish.” (<i>The New York Times</i>)</p> <p>How should schools prepare students for the Information Age? The successful worker of the future - a creative, independent thinker who works well in teams - would seem to be too self-contradictory to be the deliberate product of a school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A century ago, the American educator Caroline Pratt created an innovative school that she hoped would produce such independent thinkers, but she asked herself a different question: \"Was it unreasonable to try to fit the school to the child, rather than...the child to the school?” A strong-willed small-town schoolteacher who ran a one-room schoolhouse by the time she was 17, Pratt came to viscerally reject the teaching methods of her day, which often featured a long-winded teacher at the front of the room and rows of miserable children, on benches nailed to the floor, stretching to the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In this classic 1948 memoir, now in its fourth edition, Pratt recounts, in a wry authorial voice much closer to Will Rogers than John Dewey, how she founded what is now the dynamic City and Country School in New York City; invented the maple \"unit blocks” that have become a staple in classrooms and children’s homes around the globe; and came to play an important role in reimagining preschool and primary-school education in ways that resound in the tumultuously creative age before us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2014 edition features a new introduction by Ian Frazier, as well as a new chapter, \"C&amp;C at 100\", by former principal Kate Turley, and an afterword by Susan F. Semel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Read by Becky Ann Baker, Ian Frazier, and Kate Turley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Featured music: \"School Song\" by Larry Goldings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>City and Country School wishes to thank Kiran Paranjpe, for initiating this production and for assisting in its development.</p>";
