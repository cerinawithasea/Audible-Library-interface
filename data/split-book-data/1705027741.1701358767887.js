window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When beloved educator Hadas Winnick was murdered, her sleepy, affluent hometown of Calabasas was rocked to the core. More shocking than her killing, though, was the process of convicting her admittedly guilty murderer.</b></p> <p>Calabasas is a quiet, well-to-do California town often referred to as “The Bubble”. But on September 25th, 2007, that bubble burst with the murder of one of its longtime residents - high school math teacher Hadas Winnick. The upscale community was rocked by her gruesome death, but as shocking as the tragedy seemed, the years of abuse she faced that preceded it were more so. Even more devastating still, was the effort and time it took to sentence her murderer to prison, and the power that our systems-in-place allowed him while on his way there. Follow Hadas' daughter, award-winning blogger Amy Chesler, on her often heart-wrenching - but eventually heartwarming - road to justice.</p>";
