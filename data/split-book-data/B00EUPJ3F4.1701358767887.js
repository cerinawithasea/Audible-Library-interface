window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“The beautiful owner of this book is dearer to me than my life - August your protector.” This one sentence was the key to a mystery involving some of the greatest and most infamous figures in European history, from Frederick the Great to Napoleon and Hitler - and solved by the author of this book. </p> <p>Eve Haas is the daughter of a German Jewish family that took refuge in London after Hitler came to power. Following a terrifying air raid in the blitz, her father revealed the family secret - that her great-great grandmother Emilie was married to a Prussian prince. He then showed her the treasured leather-bound notebook inscribed to Emilie by the prince. </p> <p>Her parents were reluctant to learn more, but later in life, when Eve was married and inherited the diary, she became obsessed with proving this birthright. <i>The Secrets of the Notebook</i> tells how she follows the clues, from experts on European royalty in London to archives in West Germany and then, under threat of being arrested as a spy by the Communist regime, to an archive in East Germany that had never before opened its doors to the West. What she unearths is a love story set against the upheaval of the Napoleonic wars and the anti-Semitism of the Prussian court - and a ruse that both protected Emilie’s daughter and probably condemned her granddaughter - Eve’s beloved grandmother, Anna - to death in the Nazi camps. </p> <p>When first published in the UK, <i>The Secrets of the Notebook</i> was an <i>Irish Times</i> best seller. A movie based on the book is in production. </p>";
