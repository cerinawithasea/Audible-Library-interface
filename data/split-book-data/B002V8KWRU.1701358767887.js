window.bookSummaryJSON = "As Bill Clinton's political and business mentor, Jim McDougal, with his knowledge of embarrassing real-estate and banking deals, bribes, and obstructions of justice, long haunted the White House. McDougal's vivid self-portrait, completed only days before his death and coauthored by veteran journalist Curtis Wilkie, reveals the hidden intersections of politics and special interests in Arkansas and the betrayals that followed. <p> It is the story of how ambitious men and women climbed out of rural obscurity and \"how friendships break down and lives are ruined\". Anecdotes fall like bright coins from a raconteur's rich purse.</p> <p> \"Whitewater\" is shown for what it was, a venture in land speculation that fell victim to mismanagement and high interest rates. Lies and cover-ups were the inevitable result.</p> <p> Vintage political history, <i>Arkansas Mischief</i> is a southern tragedy with lessons for us all.</p>";
