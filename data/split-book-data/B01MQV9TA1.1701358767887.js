window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The world's only short story about a man \"impregnated\" by the departed soul of his Jewish grandmother. </p><p>Edward lives the good life in Brooklyn. Until he's haunted by a strange legacy - the memory of his deceased grandmother. It seems that Grandma has some unfinished business in this world. To get his grandmother out of his head, Edward journeys to Poland, where he wrestles with his family's complicated past. This is a story of possession, in both senses of the word - a Jewish ghost story told with humor, tenderness, and insight. Another great listen from the author of the best-selling Kindle Singles <i>False Economies</i> and <i>Adjunctivitis</i>. </p>";
