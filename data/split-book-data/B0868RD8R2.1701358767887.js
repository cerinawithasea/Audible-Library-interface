window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are many types of relations: mothers, fathers, uncles, grandparent's boyfriend and girlfriend, and the best of them all, marriage relationships (cough). The best advice you can give to a couple is to be kind and respect each other.</p> <p>Moving on from the past is essential because if you're dwelling over something done, it can hurt both partners. Mistakes are mistakes, and we are all human. There are right parts of the past and bad ones. Just try to move on from the past and create a better future. It's easier said than done, though.&nbsp;</p> <p>My common misconception of a relationship is avoiding arguments and conflicts to promote a happy relationship. I guess I've always believed that conflict destroys relationships. I was scared to try to have an honest and thoughtful argument due to the fear of possibly ruining a good relationship.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then again, I'm single, having failed in several relationships so, yeah, we usually hold on longer to something that's not working. Because we're afraid, no one else will love us, but this is how your fears ruin your chances of finding something real.</p>";
