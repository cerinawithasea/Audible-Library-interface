window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>May 1940. Hitler invades France, a move that threatens all of Europe, and three lives intersect at Wickwythe Hall, an opulent estate in the English countryside - a beautiful French refugee, a take-charge American heiress, and a charming champagne <i>vendeur </i>with ties to Roosevelt and Churchill who isn't what he seems. There, secrets and unexpected liaisons unfold, until a shocking tragedy in a far-off Algerian port binds them forever....</p> <p><i>Wickwythe Hall</i> is inspired by actual people, places, and events, including Operation Catapult, a sea action in which Churchill launched a bloody attack on the French fleet to keep the powerful ships out of Hitler's reach. More than 1,000 French sailors, who just days before fought side-by-side with the British, perished. Humanizing this forgotten piece of history, <i>Wickwythe Hall</i> takes the listener behind the blackout curtains of upper-class England, through the bustling private quarters of Churchill's Downing Street, and along the tense back alleys of occupied Vichy, illustrating what it took to survive in the dark early days of World War II.</p>";
