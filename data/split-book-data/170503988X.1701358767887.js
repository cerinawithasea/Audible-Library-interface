window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A captivating story detailing how resilience and inner strength can be combined to overcome mountainous barriers to reach one’s full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Growing up in Ferguson, Missouri, Stanley Andrisse began making poor decisions at a very young age. He started selling dope and was arrested for the first time at 14 years old. By his early 20s, dope dealing had exponentially multiplied, and he found himself sitting in front of a judge facing 20 years to life on drug-trafficking charges. The judge sentenced him to 10 years in a maximum-security prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prison was an experience like none other he’d ever encountered. While challenged with a strong desire for self-renewal, he faced an environment that was not conducive for transformative change. From poor institutional structure and policies to individual institutionalized thinking and behaviors, he battled on a daily basis to retain and maintain his humanity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Upon release, and after several rejections, Stanley was accepted into a PhD program. He completed his PhD/MBA simultaneously and became an endocrinologist and impactful leader at Johns Hopkins Medicine, specializing in diabetes research.</p>";
