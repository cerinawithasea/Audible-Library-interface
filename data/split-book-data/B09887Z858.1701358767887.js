window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In an explosive Audible Original investigative series, executive produced by James Patterson, veteran journalist and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Vicky Ward chronicles her 19-year quest to uncover what - or who - is behind Jeffrey Epstein’s wealth, influence, and criminality. You’ll hear testimonies from over 20 individuals with ties to Epstein, as well as previously off-the-record transcripts and exclusive conversations with Epstein himself.</p> <p>Ward’s journey began in 2002 when she profiled Epstein for <i>Vanity Fair</i>. At the time, she didn’t realize just how close she came to uncovering the financier’s web of secrets, connections, and wealth that enabled his sexual crimes and shielded him from justice for decades. As she investigated further, Ward would unearth ties to a criminal empire of money-laundering, gun-running, and international espionage.</p> <p>Amidst all the bold-faced names, the saga repeatedly intertwines with that of a single enigmatic figure: Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s ex-lover, former employee, and alleged co-conspirator. The disgraced heiress, who now awaits trial herself, may hold the key to unlocking the truth behind Epstein.</p>";
