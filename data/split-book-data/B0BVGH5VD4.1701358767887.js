window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the creator of the wildly popular blog Wait but Why,</b><b><i> </i></b><b>a fun and fascinating deep dive into what the hell is going on in our strange, unprecedented modern times.</b></p> <p>Between 2013 and 2016, Tim Urban became one of the world’s most popular bloggers, writing dozens of viral long-form articles about everything from AI to colonizing Mars to procrastination. Then, he turned his attention to a new topic: the society around him. Why was everything such a mess? Why was everyone acting like such a baby? When did things get so tribal? Why do humans <i>do </i>this stuff?</p> <p>This massive topic sent Tim tumbling down his deepest rabbit hole yet, through mountains of history, evolutionary psychology, political theory, neuroscience, and modern-day political movements, as he tried to figure out the answer to a simple question: <i>What’s our problem?</i></p> <p>Six years later, he emerged from the hole with this book. Narrated by the author, <i>What’s Our Problem? </i>is a deep and expansive analysis of our modern times, in the classic style of Wait but Why, packed with original concepts and sticky metaphors. The book provides an entirely new framework and language for thinking and talking about today’s complex world. Instead of focusing on the usual left-center-right horizontal political axis, which is all about <i>what</i> we think, the book introduces a vertical axis that explores <i>how</i> we think, as individuals and as groups. Listeners will find themselves on a delightful and fascinating journey that will ultimately change the way they see the world around them.</p> <p>Anyway, he wanted to say a lot more about all of this, but there was a word limit on this book description, so just go listen to the book.</p>";
