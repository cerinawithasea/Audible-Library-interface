window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Praised as “a breakneck, hair-raising comic tour of the contemporary American male psyche” by <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Drinking in America,</i> is a gritty, muscular restaging with star Andre Royo (<i>The Wire</i>) bringing to vivid life more than a dozen colorful characters, each in the throes of intoxication. Written and originated by three-time Obie Award winner Eric Bogosian, this critically acclaimed work takes on a new persona in our present day, with terms like<i> toxic masculinity</i> and <i>male fragility</i> at the forefront of the zeitgeist. In this new interpretation, <i>Drinking in America</i> continues to challenge society’s ideal of what exactly makes a man and just how easy it can be to break that same man down.</p> <p>Now available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
