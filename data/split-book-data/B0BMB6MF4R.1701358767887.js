window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dr. Douglass Garnett is about to break all the rules to save himself—and push mankind into the future.</p> <p>He’s one of America’s most brilliant neuroscientists. He’s also Black and dying of cancer. But he has a plan—a brain transfer. He’ll put his gifted mind into the body of Sammy Sturgeon, a White high school football star who was on the rise until a touchdown collision left him brain-dead.</p> <p>He convinces his co-conspirator, Dr. Dino Battaglia, to help him with the forbidden procedure. Douglass wakes up in Sammy’s White, athletic body, with his new family and legions of fans weeping at his miraculous recovery.</p> <p>As Douglass starts his life anew at Junipero Prep, complications ensue. There’s the messy breakup with Sammy’s blonde cheerleader girlfriend; then there’s an even messier relationship with his high school science teacher, Marie. Before he can win the Nobel Prize—or be charged with murder—Douglass’ transplant will force him to reconsider everything he thought he knew about race, progress, and life in America.</p> <p><i>The Man Who Haunted Himself</i> is a new sci-fi-horror classic from legendary author Ishmael Reed, who <i>The New Yorker</i> dubbed “America’s most fearless satirist”. Reed continues the literary tradition of California noir established by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett and issues a new entry into the genre he helped launch, Afrofuturism. This hilariously subversive Audible Original is expertly narrated by Adam Lazarre-White (<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, <i>Scandal</i>).</p> <p>Does the body or the brain make the man? Listen and find out.</p>";
