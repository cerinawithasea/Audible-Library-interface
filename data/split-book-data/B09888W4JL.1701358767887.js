window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How could such a dark secret have been kept for so many years?</p> <p>Police Chief Greg Adams was out on patrol. Christmas was coming to Saxonburg, Pennsylvania - a quaint borough of just 1,300 - in three short weeks. The winter air was crisp. Colored lights sparkled on houses. He was only a block and a half from the police department, and this was just an average traffic stop. Until it wasn’t.</p> <p>The devoted husband and father of two little boys was about to meet any law enforcement officer’s nightmare. Moments later, he would lay dying in a pool of his own blood on that white winter snow, while his killer vanished like an apparition into thin air.</p> <p>Despite his many aliases, the true identity of the murderer was quickly found. The killer himself was not.</p> <p>As state police and FBI investigators peeled back the twisted layers of low-level mobster Donald Webb’s life, the path to the killer would wind through decades...toward a shocking conclusion. After all, secrets can only be kept for so long.</p>";
