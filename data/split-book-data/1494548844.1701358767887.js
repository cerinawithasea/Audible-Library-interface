window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1968, during Albert Lepard's fifth escape from a life sentence at Parchman Penitentiary, he kidnapped Lovejoy Boteler, then 18 years old, from his family's farm in Grenada, Mississippi. Three decades later, still beset by half-buried memories of that time, Boteler began researching his kidnapper's nefarious, sordid life to discover how and why this terrifying abduction occurred.</p> <p>In <i>Crooked Snake</i>, Boteler pieces together the story of this cold-blooded murderer's life using both historical records and personal interviews - over 70 in all - with ex-convicts who gravitated to and ran with Lepard, the family members who fed and sheltered the fugitive during his escapes, the law officers who hunted him, and the regular folks who were victimized in his terrible wake.</p> <p>Boteler reveals his kidnapper's hardscrabble childhood and tracks his whereabouts before his incarceration and during his jailbreaks. Lepard's escapes take him to Florida, Michigan, Kansas, California, and Mexico. <i>Crooked Snake</i> captures a slice of history and a landscape that is fast disappearing.&nbsp;</p> <p>These vignettes describe Mississippi's countryside and spirit, ranging from sharecropper family gatherings in Attala County's Seneasha Valley to the 20,000-acre Parchman farm and its borderlands teeming with alligator, panther, bear, and wild boar.</p>";
