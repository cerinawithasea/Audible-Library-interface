You do not remember why you are here. You do not remember who you are. </i>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is how it begins: Select-Your-Destiny™, a storytelling experience that places the listener directly in the action by giving them the power to choose what happens. The narrator describes the circumstances, and once a Destiny Node is reached, the listener chooses what happens next. The narrator narrates, the listener chooses. That is how it has always worked—until now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In this story, the listener chooses to team up with the narrator, collaborating on what shape the story will take. A story of an unnamed teen who must piece together what’s going on after waking from suspended animation in a vacant bunker deep underground without memory. With each twist and turn, each Destiny Node, the listener and narrator begin to recover what was lost. What comes to light will transform them both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
