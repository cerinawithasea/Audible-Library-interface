Four original audio dramas were commissioned from some of the UK's most exciting emerging writers.</p> <p>The dramas were workshopped with LAMDA students and these final productions were recorded by graduating third years. The result is four brilliantly unique pilot episodes of dramas for a new generation that speak to the complex times we live in.</p> <p>We hope you enjoy listening to GNR8!</p> <p></p>";
