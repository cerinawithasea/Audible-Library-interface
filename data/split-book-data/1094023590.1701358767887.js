window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The tragic death of 13-year-old Danny Croteau in 1972 faded from headlines and memories for 20 years until the Boston abuse scandal - a string of assaults taking place within the Catholic Church - exploded in the early 2000s. Despite numerous indications, including 40 claims of sexual misconduct with minors, pointing to him as Croteau's killer, Reverend Richard R. Lavigne remains \"innocent.\"</p> <p>Drawing on more than ten thousand pages of police and court findings and interviews with Danny's friends and family, fellow abuse victims, and church officials, the author uncovers the truth - church complicity in the cover-up and masking of priests' involvement in a ring of abusive clergy - behind Croteau's death and those who had a hand in it.</p>";
