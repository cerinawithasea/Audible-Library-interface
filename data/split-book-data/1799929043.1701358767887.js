window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i></b><b>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;</b><b><i>Frozen</i></b><b>&nbsp;in this striking YA fantasy about a rig driver’s journey to save her friend.</b></p> <p>Twice-orphaned Sylvi has chipped out a niche for herself on Layce, an island cursed by eternal winter. Alone in her truck, she takes comfort in two things: the solitude of the roads and the favor of Winter, an icy spirit who has protected her since she was a child.</p> <p>Sylvi likes the road, where no one asks who her parents were or what she thinks of the rebels in the north. But when her best friend, Lenore, runs off with the rebels, Sylvi must make a haul too late in the season for a smuggler she wouldn’t normally work with, the infamous Mars Dresden. Alongside his team - Hyla, a giant warrior woman, and Kyn, a boy with skin like stone - Sylvi will do whatever it takes to save her friend.</p> <p>But when the time comes, she’ll have to choose: safety, anonymity, and the favor of Winter - or the future of the island that she calls home.</p>";
