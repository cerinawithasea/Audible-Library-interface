window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Was he his brother's keeper?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Robert and Doris Angleton seemed to have the perfect life. Until she was coldly murdered in her own home, shot 13 times in the head, chest, and abdomen....&nbsp;</p> <p>Suddenly, the ideal husband seemed anything but perfect: He was jailed, accused of hiring his older brother, Roger, to kill his wife for money - possibly as much as $2 million. However, without the crucial eyewitness testimony of Roger - who soon committed suicide in a Houston jail cell - the case against Robert rested entirely on circumstantial evidence. But the facts raise more questions than answers....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Doris Angleton - deeply involved in a secret love affair - had asked her husband for a divorce, which might have exposed him as a tax-skipping millionaire bookie and favored police informant....&nbsp;</p> <p>Extensive handwritten and typewritten notes, coupled with a secretly taped conversation between Roger and another man outlining the murder, were found in a briefcase Roger Angleton was carrying when he was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, it was later concluded that the second voice on the tape was not Robert's....&nbsp;</p> <p>Also in Roger's briefcase: $64,000 in cash, along with a money wrapper with Robert's fingerprint on it....&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, Roger confessed to the murder in his suicide note, exonerating his brother of any guilt....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A Texas jury came to one conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Listen to this fascinating true-crime account of greed, deception, and cold-blooded murder - and decide for yourself.</p>";
