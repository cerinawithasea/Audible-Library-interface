window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Whenever I hear about a hiker seeing a staircase 4 or 10 miles in the woods, I start to wonder what would be the purpose of the staircases in deep wilderness. And I think of everything from stairs being aliens' disembarking ramp from UFOs to stairs being an entry into a dimensional portal. To them being stairs that are present at that exact position but in a parallel dimension becoming visible in our aspect anonymously. Maybe that's why they are there one day but gone the next. I think we're living in some Matrix and these stairs lead out of it. And the entities that are running the simulation can come and go as they please, leaving no trace.</p>";
