window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Before Panic was our game, it was our secret. Before that, just a rumor. And before that? A ghost story. Listen close - but don’t believe everything you hear.&nbsp;</i></b></p> <p>Panic is a legendary game played by graduating seniors in the middle-of-nowhere town of Carp, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher: After a series of challenges ranging from sleeping in a haunted house to running across a highway blindfolded, one winner takes home a cash prize in the tens of thousands at the end of the summer. Participating players are sworn to secrecy, which means little is known of Panic’s history. Until now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Each of these three stories follows a former player connected to one of the game’s lingering mysteries - a ghost of Panic past, a legend. In this spellbinding novella, you’ll meet the quiet, unassuming kid who may have started it all; the golden boy who’d do anything to win; and the underestimated cheerleader who brought decades of family history into this dangerous game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Panic: Ghosts and Legends</i> is set in the world of the Amazon Original series Panic, available only on Amazon Prime Video.</p>";
