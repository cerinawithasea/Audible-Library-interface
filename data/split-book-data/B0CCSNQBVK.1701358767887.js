window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Anastasia is the princess no one needs: the fourth daughter born to an emperor without a son, and the only royal lacking a magical gift.</p> <p>Until she collides with a young Cossack rebel, changing both their lives forever.</p> <p>Damien is taken from everything he knows and raised as a ward of the Romanovs.</p> <p>Anastasia develops a strange kind of magic shared only by the Black Monk Rasputin.</p> <p>While her power grows in secret, boosted by forbidden contact with Damien, Anastasia makes a mistake with terrible consequences.</p> <p>Fate grants her a single chance to set it right, but saving what she lost may cost everything she loves.</p> <p>The Lark notes: I think what captivates us about <i>Anastasia</i> is our dream of what could have been. Anastasia’s death was so tragic that I wanted to give her another life.</p> <p>This book is not a retelling of any other Anastasia story. It’s set in 1919 in a world similar to ours, but with magic. My next series will be a vampire family saga set in the modern version of that same world.</p> <p>This is my fantasy of the happy ending Anastasia deserved. Not because she was a Romanov, but because she was a human. I want all of you to have the happy ending you deserve—it’s why I love writing romance.</p> <p><i>Anastasia </i>is an epic enemies-to-lovers fantasy romance. It is intended for mature listeners and contains spicy scenes not suitable for all ages.</p>";
