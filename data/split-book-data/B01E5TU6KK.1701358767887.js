window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Thousands of American soldiers are returning from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan with severe wounds from chemical war. They are not the victims of ruthless enemy warfare, but of their own military commanders. These soldiers, afflicted with rare cancers and respiratory diseases, were sickened from the smoke and ash swirling out of the \"burn pits\" where military contractors incinerated mountains of trash, including old stockpiles of mustard and sarin gas, medical waste, and other toxic material. </p><p>Based on thousands of government documents, over 500 in-depth medical case studies, and interviews with more than 1,000 veterans and active-duty GIs, <i>The Burn Pits</i> will shock the nation. The book is more than an explosive work of investigative journalism - it is the deeply moving chronicle of the many young men and women who signed up to serve their country in the wake of 9/11, only to return home permanently damaged, the victims of their own armed forces' criminal negligence. </p>";
