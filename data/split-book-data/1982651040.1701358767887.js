window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The final installment in the Timekeeper trilogy</p> <p>The crew of the <i>Prometheus</i> is intent on taking down the world's clock towers so that time can run freely. Now captives, Colton, Daphne, and the others have a stark choice: join the <i>Prometheus</i>' cause or fight back in any small way they can and face the consequences. But Zavier, leader of the terrorists, has a bigger plan - to bring back the lost god of time.</p> <p>As new threats emerge, loyalties must shift. No matter where the <i>Prometheus</i> goes - Prague, Austria, India - nowhere is safe, and every second ticks closer toward the 11th hour. Walking the line between villainy and heroism, each will have to choose what's most important: saving those you love at the expense of the many, or making impossible sacrifices for the sake of a better world.</p>";
