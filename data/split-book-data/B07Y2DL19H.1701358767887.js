window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My story is the story of murder, mass murder, on a scale that was until then unknown. It was premeditated and committed in cold blood. The murderers were Germans and the murdered, the Jews of Holland. The Jews were, in a process of disenfranchisement and isolation, robbed of everything, transported and in a systematic-scientific, technically efficient manner, murdered. They were city folk and farmers, orthodox, agnostic and atheist, healthy and sick, old and young, families and individuals, Dutch and Aliens: men, women, and children. Without hurry, well thought out, registered, and regimented.&nbsp;</p> <p>The murderers were often not brutes nor illiterates, but academics and intellectuals with an abiding love for literature, sculpture, and music: Many were caring fathers and mothers and during the holiday season celebrated Christmas, and, thereafter, resumed their labour: the murder of countless men, women, and children, defenceless people, fellow human beings. Mine is but one story, as seen through the eyes of one child. There are millions more.</p>";
