window.bookSummaryJSON = "In this documentary podcast, best-selling crime novelist Michael Connelly returns to his roots in journalism and examines the Wonderland Murders, an iconic and brutal mass murder in a city known for its murders. Named for the street in Laurel Canyon where the murders took place inside the house of a small-time drug gang, it’s a gruesome crime that reflected its time, disrupted a mythology and tells a broader story of Los Angeles, the American dream machine, and when justice does - and doesn’t - work. And for the first time, the podcast accesses never revealed records and exclusive interviews with investigators, prosecutors and a notorious, “missing” witness who puts all the pieces together.";
