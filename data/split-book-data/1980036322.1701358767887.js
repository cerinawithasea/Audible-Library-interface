window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Kristan Higgins, a new novel examining a family at the breaking point in all its messy, difficult, wonderful complexity. </b></p> <p>The Frosts are a typical American family. Barb and John, married almost 50 years, are testy and bored with each other...who could blame them after all this time? At least they have their daughters - Barb's favorite, the perfect, brilliant Juliet; and John's darling, the free-spirited Sadie. The girls themselves couldn't be more different, but at least they got along, more or less. It was fine. It was enough.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until the day John had a stroke, and their house of cards came tumbling down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now Sadie has to put her career as a teacher and struggling artist in New York on hold to come back and care for her beloved dad - and face the love of her life, whose heart she broke, and who broke hers. Now Juliet has to wonder if people will notice that despite her perfect career as a successful architect, her perfect marriage to a charming Brit, and her two perfect daughters, she's spending an increasing amount of time in the closet having panic attacks.&nbsp;</p> <p>And now Barb and John will finally have to face what's been going on in their marriage all along.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the author of <i>Good Luck with That </i>and <i>Life and Other Inconveniences</i> comes a new novel of heartbreaking truths and hilarious honesty about what family really means.</p>";
