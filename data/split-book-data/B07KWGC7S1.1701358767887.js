Identify the suspect.&nbsp;</p> <p>Journalist Billy Jensen spent 15 years investigating unsolved murders, fighting for the families of victims. Every story he wrote had one thing in common - it didn’t have an ending. The killer was still out there.&nbsp;</p> <p>But after the sudden death of a friend, crime writer Michelle McNamara, Billy became fed up. Following a dark night, he came up with a plan. A plan to investigate past the point when the cops have given up. A plan to solve the murders himself.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Chase Darkness with Me</i>, you’ll ride shotgun as Billy identifies the Halloween Mask Murderer, finds a missing girl in the California Redwoods, and investigates the only other murder in New York City on 9/11. You’ll hear intimate details of the hunts for two of the most terrifying serial killers in history: his friend Michelle’s pursuit of the Golden State Killer which is chronicled in <i>I’ll Be Gone In The Dark</i> which Billy helped finish after Michelle’s passing, and his own quest to find the murderer of the Allenstown 4 family.&nbsp;</p> <p>And Billy gives you the tools - and the rules - to help solve murders yourself.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gripping, complex, unforgettable, <i>Chase Darkness with Me</i> is an examination of the evil forces that walk among us, illustrating a novel way to catch those killers, and a true crime narrative unlike any you’ve listened to before.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a foreword by Karen Kilgariff of <i>My Favorite Murder</i>.&nbsp;</p>";
