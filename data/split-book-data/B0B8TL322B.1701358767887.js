Crowds at murder scenes are sometimes wildly angry, drunk, high, confused and looking at a face that is decidedly out of place in their neighborhood. In those days we wore nice clothes, even ties, if not jackets, to a crime scene. ‘Who are you?’ they asked, figuring I must be a cop, because surely, no sane person would show up unarmed in the middle of a melee.” (Frank Stanfield)</p>";
