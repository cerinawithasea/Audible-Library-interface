window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Words. We use them all the time, every day, mostly without giving them much thought at all. We take for granted that they’re here at our disposal whenever we need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But if you’ve ever wished you could communicate more effectively, words are the place to start. It’s incumbent upon you to choose the best words to accomplish your goals, because how you choose to communicate influences—well, everything! The power of communication shapes our professional goals, our relationships, and our lives—so the words we choose to use carry a great deal of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Join Dr. Allison Friederichs to discover how every single interaction we have is an opportunity to use clear and compelling communication tactics. However daunting or unpredictable the situation, we have the power to strategically choose how we communicate. Every single time. And how we communicate can change everything.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of 10 lessons, you will have fun exploring words—what they offer us, where they come from, what influences their meaning and vice versa, and how to expand your vocabulary. You’ll learn how to choose the right words for every scenario, and you’ll learn how those words can revolutionize your personal and professional life.</p>";
