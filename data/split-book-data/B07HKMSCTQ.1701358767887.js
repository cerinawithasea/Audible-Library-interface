window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On October 24, 1890, a woman's mutilated and lifeless body was discovered on a pile of rubbish in Hampstead, North London. Her arms were lacerated, her face crushed and bloodied, and her head almost completely severed from her body. A mile away a blood-soaked stroller was found leaning against a residential gate. The dead baby's body, hidden beneath a nettle bush, was not located until the following morning.</p> <p>So began the incredible story of the Hampstead Tragedy.</p> <p>Eventually, Scotland Yard knocked on the door of 2 Priory Street, home to Mary Eleanor Pearcey, the pretty 24-year-old mistress of the victim's husband, whose crimes inspired speculation that Jack the Ripper was a woman, and whose dying request was as bizarre and mysterious as her life.</p> <p>The first full-length examination of the extraordinary case, <i>Woman at the Devil's</i> <i>Door</i> is a thrilling look at a notorious murderess and the webs she wove.</p>";
