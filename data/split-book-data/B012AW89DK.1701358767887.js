window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's the first century AD, and Marcus Didius Falco, ancient Rome's favorite son and sometimes palace spy, has just been dealt a lousy blow from the gods: the beautiful, high-born Helena Justina has left him in the dust. So when the Emperor Vespasian calls upon him to investigate an act of treason, Falco is more than ready for a distraction. Disguised as an idle vacationer in the company of his best friend Petronius, Falco travels from the Isle of Capreae to Neapolis and all the way to the great city of Pompeiiâ€¦where a whole new series of Herculean events - involving yet another conspiracy and a fateful meeting with his beloved Helena - are about to erupt. </p> <p>Lindsey Davis' <i>Shadows in Bronze</i> is historical mystery at its best.</p>";
