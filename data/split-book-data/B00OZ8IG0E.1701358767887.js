window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get up close and personal with an amazing creature that has invaded our lexicon as well as our restaurants. It breathes with tubes, it has no head or brain, it feeds through a filter, and it is the source of dozens of familiar proverbs (\"happy as a clam!\"). Clams, it turns out, have been worshipped (by the Moche people of ancient Peru), used as money (by the Algonquin Indians), and consumed by people for thousands of years. Yet <i>The Secret Life of Clams</i> is the first adult trade book to deal exclusively with this gastronomic treat that is more complex than its simple two shells might reveal. <i>The Secret Life of Clams</i> features compelling insights, captivating biology, wry observations, and up-to-the-minute natural history that will keep listeners engaged and enthralled. </p><p>Written by award-winning science author Anthony D. Fredericks, <i>The Secret Life of Clams</i> includes a comfortable infusion of humor, up-to-date research, fascinating individuals (scientists and laypeople alike), and the awe of a fellow explorer as he guides listeners on a journey of wonder and adventure. Along with an appreciation for oceanic creatures, this is a guidebook for armchair marine biologists everywhere who seek amazing discoveries in concert with compelling narration.</p>";
