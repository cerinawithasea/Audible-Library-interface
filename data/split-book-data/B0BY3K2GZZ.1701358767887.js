The dream gig takes a dark turn, however, as Lili immediately dives into an eerie recount of her childhood. In stories about the dangerous tenement she grew up in, Lili reveals the friendships she formed and the disturbing experiences they all endured together—some of which still haunt her.</p> <p>Captivated by the tales and obsessed with the prospect of being the one to tell Lili's story to the rest of the world, Harriet ignores the red flags signaling the novelist may not be in her right mind...or that something even more sinister is happening.</p> <p>Created by Aditi Brennan Kapil and unfolding over six episodes, <i>Marrow</i> is a harrowing psychological thriller that asks: Is anyone ever really who they say they are? As Lili’s tale unearths winding paths of trauma, lies, and deceit, to a shocking revelation, Harriet’s dream will be completely—and irrevocably—shattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Aditi Brennan Kapil was awarded a commission through the Audible Emerging Playwrights Fund, an initiative dedicated to developing innovative original plays driven by language and voice. As an Audible-commissioned playwright, she received funding and creative support to develop </i><b><i>Marrow</i></b><i>. </i></p> <p><b>Portions of this audiobook contain mature language.
