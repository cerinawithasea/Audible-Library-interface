window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s the artist’s age-old dilemma: follow your conscience or follow the cash. So when a canceled movie star reaches out to up-and-coming writer Ivey Viola to discuss a mysterious project, she uses the opportunity to escape mid-pandemic New York for his private island with her roommate in tow. However, once on the island, she realizes that the cost of working with the toxic, closeted actor might be more than she’s willing to accept...or can refuse.</p> <p>In this satirical new play from Nick Jones, <i>Complicity Island</i> explores the business of “show business”, offering a radical, irreverent look at cancel culture, the Hollywood elite, and the real price of selling out.</p>";
