window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Show That Never Ends</i> is the behind-the-scenes story of the extraordinary rise and fall of progressive (\"prog\") rock, epitomized by such classic, chart-topping bands as Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, and Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer, and their successors Rush, Styx, and Asia. With inside access to all the key figures, <i>Washington Post</i> national reporter David Weigel tells the story with the gusto and insight prog rock's fans (and its haters) will relish. Along the way he explains exactly what was \"progressive\" about prog rock, how it arose from psychedelia and heavy metal, why it dominated the pop charts but then became so despised that it was satirized in <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i>, and what fuels its resurgent popularity today. </p>";
