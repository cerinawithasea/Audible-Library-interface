window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>By the time of his death on July 23, 1885, Ulysses S. Grant was an icon in the historical memory of the United States. Just a few decades later, however, constant criticism of his military and political leadership had tarnished his reputation.</p> <p>Today’s historians have a far more balanced assessment of Grant as a Union Army general and an American president—and that appraisal is at the heart of <i>Understanding Ulysses S. Grant: Portrait of a Warrior</i>. Rich in anecdotes that bring the man to life, this Audible Original takes you from Grant’s formative years as a shy boy from Ohio and then a soldier in the Mexican-American War to his eventual command of the Union Army during the Civil War and his post-presidential world tour as a symbol of a new American identity. Throughout, Professor Elizabeth D. Samet leverages recent academic insights to shed new light on Grant’s many triumphs (and failings), and to create a fascinating, well-rounded portrait of a complicated warrior, leader, American, and human being.</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt maintained that Grant was among the “mightiest” US presidents, in a league with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Was he right? Decide for yourself.</p>";
