window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From two veteran historians comes an intelligent and spirited history of Charles II's dissolute life and surprising legacy. To refer to the private life of Charles II is to abuse the adjective. His personal life was anything but private. His amorous liaisons were largely conducted in royal palaces surrounded by friends, courtiers, and literally hundreds of servants and soldiers. Gossip radiated throughout the kingdom. Charles spent most of his wealth and his intellect on gaining and keeping the company of women, from the lowest of society such as the actress Nell Gwyn to the aristocratic Louise de KÃ©rouaille. Some of Charles' women played their part in the affairs of state, coloring the way the nation was run. </p> <p>The authors take us inside Charles' palace, where we will meet court favorites, amusing confidants, advisors jockeying for political power, mistresses past and present, as well as key figures in Charles' inner circle, including his \"pimpmasters\" and his personal pox doctor. </p> <p>The astonishing personal life of Charles II reveals much about the man he was and why he lived and ruled as he did. <i>The King's Bed</i> tells the compelling story of a king ruled by his passion. </p>";
