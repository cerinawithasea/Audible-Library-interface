window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Talented Mr. Ripley </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>Catch Me If You Can</i></b><b> in this riveting, stranger-than-fiction story of the French con artist whose crimes span decades and continents.</b></p> <p>In 2019, veteran journalist Mark Seal began investigating the suspicious death of music mogul Peter Ikin. Just 32 days before he was found dead in his Paris hotel room, Ikin had married a handsome, debonair Frenchman named Alexandre, who would claim to be entitled to his late husbandâ€™s fortune. As Seal dug into the case, he had no idea that tracing the incredible life of Alexandre Despallieres would take him from Paris to London to Beverly Hills, and unspool a web of intricate plots and deceptions that, for a time, made Despallieres a millionaire and left multiple alleged victims dead in his wake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Mark Seal uncovers impossible stories about a man who seems to evade justice at every turn.&nbsp;</p>";
