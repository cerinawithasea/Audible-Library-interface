window.bookSummaryJSON = "For O.J. Simpson to get away with murder, an innocent cop, a brilliant detective, had to be destroyed. That was the cynical strategy of the Simpson defense. But as certainty about Simpson's guilt grew, so did the outrage about the scapegoating of Mark Fuhrman. Now the former LAPD detective tells his side of the story in a damning expose. <p> Fuhrman takes the listener on a detective's journey through the crucial first 24 hours of the investigation. We uncover not only the bloody glove but also explosive new evidence recorded by Fuhrman and his partner at the scene but astonishingly never presented at the trial. New revelations about the incompetence and corruption that pervaded the \"Trial of the Century\" will set the record straight.</p>";
