window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Claudio Bianchi has lived alone for many years on a hillside in Southern Italy's scenic Calabria. Set in his ways and suspicious of outsiders, Claudio has always resisted change, preferring farming and writing poetry. But one chilly morning, as though from a dream, an impossible visitor appears at the farm. When Claudio comes to her aid, an act of kindness throws his world into chaos. Suddenly he must stave off inquisitive onlookers, invasive media, and even more sinister influences. </p> <p>Lyrical, gripping, and wise, <i>In Calabria</i> confirms Peter S. Beagle's continuing legacy as one of fantasy's most legendary authors. </p>";
