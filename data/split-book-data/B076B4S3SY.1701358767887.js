window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Performed by the acclaimed actor Michael B. Jordan (<i>The Wire</i>, <i>Fantastic Four</i>, <i>Creed</i>), <i>Upstanders</i> is a stirring tribute to the ordinary people who make a remarkable difference in big cities and small towns across the country. </p><p>For more than a year, Howard Schultz, the chairman and former CEO of Starbucks, and former <i>Washington Post</i> senior correspondent and associate editor Rajiv Chandrasekaran searched the country for even more of America's unsung heroes, as a follow-up to <i>Upstanders</i>' first season. Now you'll hear the stories and voices of the people they found - local citizens who are demonstrating unbelievable courage and inspiring a better America at a time when we need these heroes more than ever. </p><p>From the Dallas chef who's staffing his restaurant with former juvenile offenders, to the Missoula, Montana mother who opened her community's hearts and doors to refugees, to the Seattle firefighter who's helping to destigmatize post-traumatic stress among our nation's first responders - the 11 individuals featured in this second volume of <i>Upstanders</i> embody the American spirit and much of what's missing from today's national debate over how to salvage America's soul. </p><p>Through their passion for humanity, courage to lead, and willingness to act, the Upstanders we celebrate here remind us that we all have the power to create positive change in our communities and beyond. </p>";
