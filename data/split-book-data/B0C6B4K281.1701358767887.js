window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two best friends, five hot guys, one dream vacation. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Lori is beautiful, smart, and athletic. The one thing she can’t do is speak up for herself: She can’t stand up to a creepy guy at the gym, she can’t speak to her crush, and she certainly can’t tell her parents that she wants to take a year off to backpack around Europe rather than follow family tradition and go to med school. When her best friend, Faye, invites her on an all-expenses-paid, weeklong trip to a sunny destination with Faye’s brother, Adam, and four of his friends, she jumps at the chance to leave all her problems behind.</p> <p>Faye is Lori’s opposite in a lot of ways—maybe that’s why they’re such good friends. In fact, the only problem in Faye’s life is that her brother hates her, and she’s hooking up with his best friend, Kellan, behind his back. She can’t let Adam find out, as that’ll only make their relationship worse. At the same time, she doesn’t want a hookup; she wants a real relationship with Kellan. This vacation is her chance to figure out if he’s in this for real or not.</p> <p>When Faye hatches a scheme designed to make Kellan jealous, she drags everyone else into her drama—including Lori and her gym crush, who just happens to be on this trip too! Soon everyone is fighting with everyone else, and relationships are being ripped apart as secrets are revealed. Going on the best vacation ever may turn out to be the worst decision ever.</p> <p>This delightful, stand-alone novel from YA superstar Jessica Cunsolo deals with romance and friendship, but it’s also about learning to stand up for yourself and be who you want to be.</p>";
