window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wit, wisdom, and revelations from 60 years of life on the road.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Driving one highway after another at sunrise, winding through the mountainside, hearing the call to rise of the roosters, or simply exchanging \"fishing stories\" with the other guys at the truck stops. Like that one about the trucker who stopped along the highway and helped a little old lady who had a flat tire. By the time the trucker had told his tale a dozen times, the simple tire change story turned into one where an old lady was accompanied by her gorgeous, blond, and 21-year-old granddaughter - you know how that ends. Imagine the story traded from one driver to the next. Each time, a more outrageous yarn is spun.&nbsp;</p> <p>They say that only truck drivers experience the true grandeur and landscape of America. In <i>A Trucker's Tale</i>, Ed Miller gives an inside look at the allure of the work and the colorful characters who haul our goods on the open road. He shares what it was like to grow up in a trucking family, his experience as an equipment officer in Vietnam, and the trials and tribulations of life as a trucker. His tales are often funny, sometimes sad, cringeworthy, or unbelievable. Many are the results of what he calls \"just plain stupidity.\" Together they paint a compelling portrait of a vibrant but little-known industry, and reveal why he just kept on truckin'.</p>";
