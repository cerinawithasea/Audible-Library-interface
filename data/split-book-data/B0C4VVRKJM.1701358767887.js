window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before lesbian TikTok, before <i>The L Word</i>, before Ellen, there was <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i>, Alison Bechdel’s seminal comic-strip sensation about the lives and loves of one tight-knit dyke community that was a fixture in gay papers across America for 25 years.</p> <p>Meet our heroine, Mo. She’s every dyke’s dream—or so she’s been told by her kind and supportive friends. She’s shy but passionate, politically aware, as committed to her egalitarian all-womyn’s softball team as she is to her volunteer work at the Gay and Lesbian Community Center. So why can’t she find a girlfriend? Could it possibly be because she’s more judgmental than Gertrude Stein and more self-sabotaging than Bojack Horseman?</p> <p>And what about Lois, Mo’s best buddy and Casanova about town? She’s broken a thousand hearts in her day, but can she protect her own from the powers of Emma, the sultry divorcee?</p> <p>And what about Clarice, Mo’s first girlfriend and chosen family? Will her long-term stable partnership with Toni survive her dizzying attraction to Ginger, the alluring academic?</p> <p>Follow the trials and tribulations of Mo, Lois, Toni, Clarice, and the rest of their friends as they surf the waves of dyke drama from the softball field to the women’s bookstore, from the brunch rush at the vegan Café Topaz all the way to the steps of the Supreme Court, in a very special episode set at the landmark 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.</p> <p>From the fevered mind of Alison Bechdel, MacArthur Genius Award-winning author of <i>Fun Home</i> and <i>Are You My Mother?</i>, <i>Alison Bechdel’s Dykes to Watch Out For</i> is an American classic, brought hilariously to life in this new comedy by a star-studded crew, including Carrie Brownstein (<i>Portlandia</i>), Roberta Colindrez (<i>A League of Their Own</i>), Roxane Gay (<i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Bad Feminist</i>) Jenn Colella (Broadway’s <i>Come from Away</i>), and the celesbian icon herself, Jane Lynch (<i>Glee</i>).</p> <p>Adapted by playwright and Pulitzer Prize finalist Madeleine George (<i>Only Murders in the Building</i>), directed by Tony nominee Leigh Silverman (<i>Violet</i>), with original music by Alana Davis, Faith Soloway, and Bitch, and a soundtrack featuring hits by Ferron, Holly Near, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Cris Williamson, and Joan Jett.</p> <p>Don’t miss Audible’s hottest new queer original, <i>Alison Bechdel’s Dykes to Watch Out For</i>!
