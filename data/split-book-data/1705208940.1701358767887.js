window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller: The \"fascinating\" true story of John Dale Cavaness, a much-admired Illinois doctor - and the cold-blooded killer of his own son (</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>). </b></p> <p>Fusing the narrative power of an award-winning novelist and the detailed research of an experienced investigator, author Darcy O'Brien unfolds the story of Dr. John Dale Cavaness, the southern Illinois physician and surgeon charged with the murder of his son Sean in December 1984.&nbsp;</p> <p>Outraged by the arrest of the skilled medical practitioner who selflessly attended to their needs, the people of Little Egypt, as the natives call their region, rose to his defense. But during the subsequent trial, a radically different, disquieting portrait of Dr. Cavaness would emerge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the three decades that he enjoyed the admiration and respect of his community, Cavaness was privately terrorizing his family, abusing his employees, and making disastrous financial investments. As more and more grisly details of the Cavaness case come to stark Midwestern light in O'Brien's chilling account, so too does the hidden gothic underside of rural America and its heritage of violence and blood.</p>";
