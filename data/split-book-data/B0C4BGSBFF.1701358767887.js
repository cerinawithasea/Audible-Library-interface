window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Make a wish.</i></p> <p>The words have haunted Rashmi since she first heard them whispered the night before her mother died, when she was just 10 years old. Rashmi’s mother used to tell her stories of a magical garden lit only by the moon, whose blossoms grant wishes. For years, Rashmi believed the whisper somehow came from the mysterious moon garden of her mother’s stories and that her own failure to respond—to wish—may have cost her mother her life.</p> <p>Now a scientist working for her grandfather’s biotech company on a treatment for Alzheimer disease, Rashmi tells herself the entreaty she heard as a child was an illusion, nothing more than a dream. She throws herself into her research, betting everything on its success, even her relationship with Darsh, her perfect Bollywood-star boyfriend. But when Darsh gifts her a rare chapbook by a vanished poet, entitled <i>Into the Moon Garden</i>, Rashmi can’t help but be lured back into the past.</p> <p>The moon garden calls to her once more, and this time, Rashmi answers, crossing its threshold with her life’s wish in her heart: to right the wrong of all those years ago. But as she ventures deeper into the moon garden, and into her past, Darsh—her future—follows her, pulling her in another direction entirely....</p>";
