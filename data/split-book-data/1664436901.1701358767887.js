window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Will a serial killer soon walk the streets again?</b></p> <p>Don Miller was quiet and reserved. As a former youth pastor, he seemed a devout Christian. No one would have ever suspected that the recent graduate of the Michigan State University School of Criminal Justice was a serial killer.</p> <p>However, when Miller was arrested for the attempted murder of two teenagers in 1978, police quickly realized he was probably responsible for the disappearances of four women. Offered a still-controversial plea bargain, he led police to the bodies of the missing women.</p> <p>Now, after 40 years in prison, Miller has served his time and is due to be released into an unsuspecting population. In <i>Killing Women</i>, author Rod Sadler examines the crimes, the “justice” meted out, and the impending freedom of a man nationally renowned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Ochberg described as “a member of a small, deadly, dangerous population: murderers who stalk, capture, torture, and kill; murderers who derive sexual and narcissistic gratification from their predation; murderers who maintain a ‘mask of sanity’ appearing normal and harmless.”</p>";
