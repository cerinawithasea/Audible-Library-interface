window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A charming and delightful reminiscence of growing up loving the woods, waters, fields, and fauna of Massachusetts by Michael Tougias, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Finest Hours</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Overboard!</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Fatal Forecast</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Untamed. Unsupervised. Uncontrolled.</p> <p>Boyhood in the 1960s and ‘70s was a time for exploration and mischief. Author Michael Tougias found more than his share of misadventures in the woods and on the water: some life-threatening, but others innocently hilarious.</p> <p>Over time - and after reading a multitude of adventure books - these experiences took shape in his quest to be a mountain man, owning a cabin in the forest and living off the land. Part of that dream would come true, but only after a family tragedy that shook his world and forced changes in his life.</p> <p>This is also a story of a complex and strained relationship between father and son, the efforts at understanding, and ultimately respect and devotion.</p> <p>In <i>The Waters Between Us</i> Tougias channels Bryson’s <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> to mix laugh out loud humor with insight into the natural world through the eyes of a curious boy.</p>";
