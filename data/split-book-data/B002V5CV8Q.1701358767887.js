Hung on the wall before her is one of Matisse's iconic portraits.</p><p>In \"Art Works\", the three inhabitants of one household - a generous wife, her petulant husband, and their regal housekeeper - make very different artists.</p><p>And in \"The Chinese Lobster\", a self-tortured, anorexic art student confronts the smug opulence of Matisse's nudes while pondering suicide.</p>";
