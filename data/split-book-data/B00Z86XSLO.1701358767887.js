window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sisterhood in all its drama, hilarity, and tears is at the heart of <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Kristan Higgins' thoroughly captivating new novel, featuring the wit and romance that listeners have come to expect from the much-loved creator of the Blue Heron series. </p> <p>Wedding-dress designer Jenny Tate understands the happily ever after business, yet somehow she's still involved in her ex-husband's life. In fact Owen's new wife may - inexplicably - be Jenny's new best friend. Sensing this, well, relationship isn't helping her move on, Jenny trades the Manhattan skyline for her hometown up the Hudson, where she'll be able to bask in her sister Rachel's picture-perfect family life...and hopefully make one of her own. </p> <p>Her timing couldn't be more perfect, since Rachel will need her younger sister. Her idyllic marriage has just fallen to pieces in spectacular fashion after she discovers her husband sexting with one of his colleagues. Second chances aren't in Rachel's nature, but the desire for an intact family has her rethinking her stance on adultery, much to Jenny's surprise. Rachel points to their parents' \"perfect\" marriage as a shining example. But to protect her sister, Jenny may have to tarnish that memory - and their relationship - and reveal a secret about their family she's been keeping since childhood. </p> <p>During this summer of secrets and lies, temptation and revelation, Jenny and Rachel will rely on each other to find the humor in their personal catastrophes, the joy in their triumphs...and the strength to keep hanging on. </p>";
