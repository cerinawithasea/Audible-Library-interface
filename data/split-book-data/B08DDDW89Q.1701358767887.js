window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>[Contains explicit content.] </p> <p>University student Anna Winslow has gone missing. The circumstances of her disappearance are far from ordinary, a fact that only fellow student Melissa Lopez appears to appreciate. Motivated by an unexplained and disturbing voicemail message from Anna on the night of her disappearance, Melissa's curiosity quickly turns into a deeper investigation, an obsession even, which she chronicles as a regular podcast - the very recordings that you are about to listen to. She quickly discovers that Anna was a loner with hearing difficulties and had disappeared for a week earlier in the year, only to return with perfect hearing, but with increasingly unstable behavior. </p> <p>When you add <i>Unheard: The Story of Anna Winslow</i> to your library you will receive all 8 episodes, each with a runtime of approximately 30 minutes.</p>";
