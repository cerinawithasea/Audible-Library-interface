window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When white supremacist Wade Michael Page murdered six people and wounded four in a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin in 2012, Pardeep Kaleka was devastated. The temple leader, now dead, was his father. His family, who had immigrated to the US from India when Pardeep was young, had done everything right. Why was this happening to him? Meanwhile, Arno Michaelis, a former skinhead and founder of one of the largest racist skinhead organizations in the world, had spent years of his life committing terrible acts in the name of white power. When he heard about the attack, waves of guilt washing over him, he knew he had to take action and fight against the very crimes he used to commit.</p> <p>After the Oak Creek tragedy, Arno and Pardeep worked together to start an organization called Serve 2 Unite, which works with students to create inclusive, compassionate, and nonviolent climates in their schools and communities. Their story is one of triumph of love over hate and of two men who breached a great divide to find compassion and forgiveness. With <i>New York Times</i> best seller Robin Gaby Fisher telling Arno and Pardeep's story, <i>The Gift of Our Wounds</i> is a timely reminder of the strength of the human spirit and the courage and compassion that reside within us all.</p>";
