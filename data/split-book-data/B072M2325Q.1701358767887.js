window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lakshmi, called Lucky, is an unemployed millennial programmer. She likes to dance and have a drink or two, and she makes art on commission. Fifty bucks gets you high-resolution digital images of anything you want (orcs, mermaids, cos-playing couples in sexy boudoir scenes) and a nice frameable print. Lucky's husband, Krishna, is an editor for a greeting card company. Both are secretly gay. They present their conservative Sri Lankan American families with a heterosexual front while each dates on the side. </p> <p>When Lucky's grandmother has a nasty fall, Lucky returns to her mother's home to act as caretaker and unexpectedly reconnects with her childhood best friend and first lover, Nisha. Nisha has agreed to an arranged marriage with a man she doesn't know but finds herself attracted to her old friend. The attraction is mutual, and Lucky tries to save Nisha from entering a marriage based on a lie. But does Nisha really want to be saved? And what does Lucky want, anyway? To live openly means that Lucky would lose most of the community she was born into - a community she loves, an irreplaceable home. Lucky, an outsider no matter what choices she makes, is pushed to the breaking point. </p>";
