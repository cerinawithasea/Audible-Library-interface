window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"If you love a <i>Law &amp; Order</i> marathon and binged <i>True Detective</i> in one go, <i>Exeter </i>might be your new favorite podcast.‚Äù (<i>The New York Times</i>)</p> <p>From writer/director Ronnie Gunter, <i>Exeter </i>is a gripping crime mystery starring Jeanne Tripplehorn (<i>Big Love</i>, <i>Criminal Minds</i>) and Ray McKinnon (<i>Dopesick</i>, <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>).</p> <p>Set in rural South Carolina in 1995, a veteran detective is forced to reconcile the errors of a past case when a woman she convicted of murder is exonerated after 10 years in prison. Meanwhile, a series of grisly and ritualistic murders rock their decaying town, and our heroine is put at odds against her ambitious partner as they race to put the pieces together.</p> <p>Filled with peculiar and authentic characters, <i>Exeter </i>examines the nature of innocence, justice, and the price that is paid for following your instincts to discover deeper truths.</p> <p>Note: Listeners do not have to start <i>Exeter </i>on season one. There is progression from season to season, but each season can stand on its own and does not have to be listened to in order.</p> <p>Content warning: This show is for mature audiences only. It contains adult language and themes. Discretion is advised.</p>";
