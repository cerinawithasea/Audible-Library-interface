window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up in rural Saskatchewan, Troy Schaab’s life focused on hockey and the farm—though his true love was music. Spending the last two years of high school in North Battleford to play hockey, he soon realized that his dream of becoming a heavy metal drummer was not realistic, and he began preparing for a future back on the farm. Before he packed his bags, his friend persuaded him to come to an open house at Saskatoon’s Western Academy Broadcasting College, which changed Troy’s life forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Troy wasn’t sure of his career choice. Having sent out hundreds of demos after graduation, he had yet to hear back from a single station. With sheer determination to make it in this field, he lucked out and began interning at various stations, beginning with a night shift at Saskatoon’s Sun 102 FM. Getting a taste for radio DJing, Troy worked across the prairie provinces, finding success with his first evening host gig at Country 108 CKSA in Lloydminster. Here, his luck began to change, along with his name: Troy Stevens instead of Schaab. Soon he was interviewing country music’s greats—starting with Shania Twain—and was on cloud nine, only to have his dream topped off by meeting the love of his life: Sonia Sawyer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Becoming an inseparable team, they married, travelled together, and always dreamed big. So, it was no surprise that after four years of being a co-host for Red Deer’s morning show, <i>The Troy and Gloria Show</i> at Zed 99, that Troy wanted more or wanted out. Though he still enjoyed his profession, he couldn’t help but wonder if there was something more for him in this career. With one final roll of the dice, he set out to build a new legacy within the broadcasting industry.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Go with Me on This</i> follows the dream of Troy “Stevens” Schaab in radio, sharing the ins and outs of the profession, and how determination and passion for one’s career can bring the biggest joys in life.</p>";
