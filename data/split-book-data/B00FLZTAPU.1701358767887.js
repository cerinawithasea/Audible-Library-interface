window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 50 years, you're aware of the many hypotheses that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was not done by one man. Whether you've listened to one or a dozen of the audiobooks on this topic, there's no way to fully grasp the depth of this conspiracy. </p> <p>For the first time ever, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors Jesse Ventura and Dick Russell have teamed up with some of the most respected and influential assassination researchers to put together the ultimate compendium that covers every angle - from the plot to the murder - of JFK. <i>They Killed Our President</i> will not only discuss the most famous of theories, but will also bring to light new and recently discovered information, which together shows that the United States government not only was behind this egregious plot, but took every step to make sure that the truth would not come out. </p> <p>With 2013 marking the fiftieth anniversary of JFK's assassination, this is the perfect time for <i>They Killed Our President</i> to be available to listeners. The research and information in this audiobook are unprecedented, and there's nobody better to bring this to everyone's attention than the former governor of Minnesota and US Navy SEAL, Jesse Ventura. </p>";
