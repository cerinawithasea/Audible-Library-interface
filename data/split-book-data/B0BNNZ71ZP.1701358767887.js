window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Please note this audiobook contains strong language and content that some listeners may find upsetting. Discretion is advised.</b></p> <p>As they recount the events surrounding the disappearance of their toddler—one with a tendency to bite—two parents cope with grief in vastly different ways. While the father wrestles with feelings of guilt, the mother is convinced she’s spotted the boy in frightening TV news reports...though let’s just say he looks nothing like the precocious little boy they remember from a decade ago. A heart-pounding, psychological journey of unimaginable proportions thrillingly brought to life by Arian Moayed, Celia Keenan-Bolger, and Stephanie Hsu (as a young doctor in the midst of disaster), James Fritz’s <i>Skyscraper Lullaby</i> is a haunting examination of the ways we cope with tragedy, complicity, and remorse… or the lack thereof.</p> <p>Playwright James Fritz was awarded a commission through the Audible Emerging Playwrights Fund, an initiative dedicated to developing innovative original plays driven by language and voice. As an Audible-commissioned playwright, he received funding and creative support to develop <i>Skyscraper Lullaby.</i></p> <p>Sound design and composition by Max Perryment.</p>";
