window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Through the lens of horror—from </b><b><i>Halloween</i></b><b> to </b><b><i>Hereditary</i></b><b>—queer and trans writers consider the films that deepened, amplified, and illuminated their own experiences.</b></p> <p>Horror movies hold a complicated space in the hearts of the queer community: historically misogynist, and often homo- and transphobic, the genre has also been inadvertently feminist and open to subversive readings. Common tropes—such as the circumspect and resilient “final girl,” body possession, costumed villains, secret identities, and things that lurk in the closet—spark moments of eerie familiarity and affective connection. Still, viewers often remain tasked with reading themselves into beloved films, seeking out characters and set pieces that speak to, mirror, and parallel the unique ways queerness encounters the world.</p> <p><i>It Came from the Closet</i> features twenty-five original essays by writers speaking to this relationship, through connections both empowering and oppressive. From Carmen Maria Machado on <i>Jennifer’s Body</i>, Jude Ellison S. Doyle on <i>In My Skin</i>, Addie Tsai on <i>Dead Ringers</i>, and many more, these conversations convey the rich reciprocity between queerness and horror.</p> <p>Full cast: Daniel Henning,&nbsp;André Santana,&nbsp;Tori Barron,&nbsp;Ron Butler, Emmett Grosland,&nbsp;Lindsey Dorcus,&nbsp;Joel Froomkin,&nbsp;Aven Shore, Mike Cooper,&nbsp;Mark Sanderlin,&nbsp;Krystal Hammond,&nbsp;Graham Halstead,&nbsp;Aida Reluzco,&nbsp;Hope Newhouse, Vikas Adam.</p>";
